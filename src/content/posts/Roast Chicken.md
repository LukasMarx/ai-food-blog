## FAQ

### What temperature should I roast the chicken at?

We recommend roasting the chicken at 375°F (190°C) for about 1 hour and 20 minutes or until the thickest part of the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).

### How do I ensure the chicken is juicy and not dry?

To ensure the chicken stays juicy, you can stuff the cavity with herbs, garlic, and lemon wedges. You can also baste the chicken with melted butter or olive oil every 30 minutes while it’s roasting.

### How long should I let the chicken rest before carving?

Let the chicken rest for at least 10-15 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute and makes the chicken more tender and flavorful.

### Can I use a different seasoning instead of salt and pepper?

Yes, you can use any seasoning you prefer. Some popular options include garlic powder, paprika, rosemary, thyme, and sage.

### How do I know when the chicken is fully cooked?

You can use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken (without touching the bone) and make sure it reads 165°F (74°C).

### Can I roast vegetables alongside the chicken?

Yes, you can add vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and onions to the pan with the chicken for a one-pan meal. Just make sure to cut them into similar sizes so they cook evenly.

### How can I make the skin crispy?

To make the skin crispy, pat the chicken dry with paper towels before seasoning it. You can also brush the skin with melted butter or oil before roasting.

### How do I carve the chicken?

Start by removing the legs and wings, then slice the breast meat into thin pieces. You can also cut along the breast bone to remove the entire breast and then slice it.

### Can I use a different type of poultry instead of chicken?

Yes, you can use this recipe for other types of poultry like turkey or Cornish hens. Just adjust the cooking time based on the weight of the bird.

### How do I store leftover roast chicken?

Let the chicken cool to room temperature, then store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. You can also freeze the chicken for up to 3 months.
