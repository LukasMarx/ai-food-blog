If you're looking for a delicious and comforting meal to enjoy, look no further than mushroom risotto. This dish is rich, creamy, and full of flavor, making it the perfect choice for a cozy night in or a dinner party with friends.

To make mushroom risotto, you'll need the following ingredients:

- 6 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Chopped parsley, for garnish

To get started, heat the broth in a saucepan and keep it warm over low heat. In a separate large saucepan, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.

Add the Arborio rice to the saucepan and stir to coat it with the butter and olive oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the rice is slightly toasted. Pour in the white wine and stir until the liquid has been absorbed by the rice.

Add the sliced mushrooms to the saucepan and cook until they are tender and the liquid they release has been absorbed by the rice, about 5-7 minutes.

Add 1 cup of warm broth to the saucepan and stir constantly until the broth has been absorbed by the rice. Repeat this process, adding 1 cup of broth at a time and stirring constantly, until the rice is tender and creamy, but still slightly al dente. This should take about 20-25 minutes.

Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until it has melted and the risotto is creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve the mushroom risotto in bowls, garnished with chopped parsley. Enjoy!
