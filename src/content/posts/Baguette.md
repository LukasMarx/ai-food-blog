## Variations

### Whole Wheat Baguette

To make whole wheat baguette, replace half of the bread flour with whole wheat flour. You may need to add a little more water to the dough as whole wheat flour absorbs more liquid.

### Garlic Baguette

Mix some garlic powder into the dough before kneading to make garlic baguette. You can also brush the tops of the baguettes with garlic butter before baking.

### Cheese Baguette

Add some grated cheese to the dough before kneading to make cheese baguette. Cheddar or Parmesan cheese work well.

## Tips

- Use a sharp knife to score the tops of the baguettes. This will help the bread to rise and give it a beautiful appearance.
- Don't overwork the dough. Knead until it becomes elastic and smooth, but don't go overboard.
- Let the baguettes cool on a wire rack before slicing. This will prevent them from becoming soggy.
