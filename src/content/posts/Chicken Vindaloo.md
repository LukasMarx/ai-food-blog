## Introduction

Chicken vindaloo is a popular Indian dish that originated in the Goa region. It is known for its spicy and tangy flavor and is usually made with chicken or lamb. The dish is traditionally made with vinegar, which gives it a unique taste. It is a perfect dish to warm you up on a chilly evening or to serve at a dinner party with friends. In this blog post, we will show you how to make chicken vindaloo at home with this easy-to-follow recipe.

## Ingredients

Here are the ingredients you will need to make chicken vindaloo for 4 portions:
- 500g boneless chicken
- 2 cups chopped onions
- 1 cup chopped tomatoes
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 2 tbsp garlic paste
- 2 tbsp ginger paste
- 1 tbsp vinegar
- Salt to taste
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 cup water

## Cooking Steps

### Step 1: Marinate the Chicken

In a large bowl, mix the chicken with cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, chili powder, garlic paste, ginger paste, and vinegar. Let it marinate for 30 minutes. This will help the chicken absorb all the flavors and spices.

### Step 2: Sauté the Onions and Tomatoes

In a pan, heat the vegetable oil and sauté the onions until they turn golden brown. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn into a paste. This will take around 5-7 minutes.

### Step 3: Cook the Chicken

Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook for 10 minutes on high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and add salt to taste. Add water and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for another 20 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. The sauce will thicken and the chicken will be tender.

### Step 4: Serve

Garnish the chicken vindaloo with freshly chopped cilantro and serve hot with rice or naan bread.

## Variations

### Vegetarian Vindaloo

If you're a vegetarian, you can make this dish with paneer or tofu instead of chicken. Marinate the paneer or tofu the same way you would with the chicken, and follow the same cooking steps.

### Lamb Vindaloo

You can also make this dish with lamb instead of chicken. Keep in mind that lamb will take longer to cook than chicken, so adjust the cooking time accordingly.

### Mild Vindaloo

If you prefer a milder version of this dish, you can reduce the amount of chili powder or omit it altogether. You can also add some yogurt or cream to the sauce to make it less spicy.
