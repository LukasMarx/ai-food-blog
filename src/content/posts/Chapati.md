## FAQ

### What is Chapati?

Chapati is a type of unleavened flatbread made from whole wheat flour. It is a staple food in many Indian households and is usually served with curries, vegetables, or lentils.

### What type of flour should I use to make Chapati?

You should use whole wheat flour, also known as atta, to make Chapati. This type of flour is finely ground and has a high gluten content, which makes it ideal for making flatbreads.

### Can I use all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour?

Yes, you can use all-purpose flour to make Chapati, but the texture and taste of the bread will be different. All-purpose flour has a lower gluten content than whole wheat flour, which means that the bread may not be as soft and chewy.

### What is the best way to knead the dough for Chapati?

To knead the dough for Chapati, mix the flour with water and knead it for several minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also add a little bit of oil or ghee to the dough to make it softer.

### Do I need to let the dough rest before making Chapati?

Yes, it is important to let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes before making Chapati. This allows the gluten in the flour to relax, which makes it easier to roll out the dough and prevents the bread from shrinking when it is cooked.

### How thin should I roll out the dough for Chapati?

You should roll out the dough for Chapati as thin as possible, ideally to a thickness of about 2-3 millimeters. This will ensure that the bread cooks evenly and becomes soft and fluffy.

### Do I need a special pan to cook Chapati?

No, you don't need a special pan to cook Chapati. You can use a regular frying pan or griddle to cook the bread. However, it is important to make sure that the pan is hot enough before cooking the bread to ensure that it cooks properly.

### How long should I cook Chapati for?

You should cook Chapati for about 30 seconds on each side, or until it is lightly browned and puffed up. Be careful not to overcook the bread, as it can become hard and dry.

### Can I freeze Chapati?

Yes, you can freeze Chapati for up to 3 months. To freeze the bread, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place it in a freezer bag. When you're ready to eat it, thaw the bread at room temperature and reheat it in a hot pan or microwave. 

### What can I serve Chapati with?

Chapati can be served with a variety of dishes, including curries, vegetables, lentils, and chutneys. It is also delicious with yogurt or raita, a type of Indian condiment made with yogurt and spices.
