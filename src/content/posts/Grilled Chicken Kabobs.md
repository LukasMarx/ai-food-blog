## FAQ

### How long should I marinate the chicken before grilling?

We recommend marinating the chicken for at least 2 hours before grilling. This will ensure that the chicken absorbs the flavors of the marinade and stays moist during grilling.

### Can I use boneless chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs?

Yes, you can use boneless chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs. However, be aware that chicken breasts tend to dry out faster during grilling, so make sure to monitor them closely and adjust the cooking time accordingly.

### Can I use wooden skewers instead of metal skewers?

Yes, you can use wooden skewers instead of metal skewers. Soak the wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before using them to prevent them from burning during grilling.

### How do I ensure that the vegetables cook evenly on the skewers?

Cut the vegetables into similar-sized pieces to ensure that they cook evenly on the skewers. You can also blanch the vegetables before skewering them to ensure that they cook through.

### Can I prepare the kabobs ahead of time?

Yes, you can prepare the kabobs ahead of time. Cover them with plastic wrap and store them in the refrigerator until you’re ready to grill them.

### How long should I grill the kabobs?

Grill the kabobs for 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender and lightly charred.

### Can I use a grill pan instead of an outdoor grill?

Yes, you can use a grill pan instead of an outdoor grill. Heat the grill pan over medium-high heat and grill the kabobs for 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender and lightly charred.

### How do I know when the chicken is cooked through?

Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken. The chicken is cooked through when the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).

### Can I use different vegetables for the kabobs?

Yes, you can use different vegetables for the kabobs. Try using bell peppers, onions, zucchini, or cherry tomatoes.

### How do I prevent the chicken from sticking to the grill?

Make sure that the grill grates are clean and well-oiled before grilling. Brush the chicken with a little oil before grilling to prevent it from sticking to the grill.
