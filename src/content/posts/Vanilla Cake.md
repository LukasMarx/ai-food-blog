## FAQ

### Can I use salted butter instead of unsalted butter in this recipe?

We recommend using unsalted butter in this recipe to have more control over the amount of salt in the cake. If you use salted butter, reduce the amount of added salt in the recipe.

### Can I substitute the cake flour with all-purpose flour?

Cake flour has a lower protein content than all-purpose flour, which allows for a more tender cake. However, if you don't have cake flour, you can make a substitute using all-purpose flour and cornstarch. For every cup of all-purpose flour, remove 2 tablespoons and replace with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. 

### Can I use almond flour instead of all-purpose flour to make a gluten-free version of this cake?

Substituting almond flour for all-purpose flour will significantly alter the texture of the cake as almond flour is much denser. For a gluten-free version of this cake, we recommend using a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend.

### Can I make this cake ahead of time and freeze it?

Yes, this cake can be made ahead of time and frozen. Wrap the cooled cake tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. When ready to serve, allow the cake to thaw in the refrigerator overnight before frosting.

### How can I make sure my cake comes out of the pan without sticking?

Make sure to grease and flour your cake pans well, or use parchment paper to line the bottom of the pans. Once the cake is done baking, let it cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before flipping it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

### Can I use a hand mixer instead of a stand mixer?

Yes, a hand mixer can be used instead of a stand mixer. Make sure to use the highest setting and mix for the recommended amount of time.

### Can I add food coloring to the batter to make a colored cake?

Yes, you can add food coloring to the batter to make a colored cake. Add the food coloring gradually until you achieve your desired color.

### Can I use this recipe to make cupcakes instead of a cake?

Yes, this recipe can be used to make cupcakes. Fill each cupcake liner 3/4 full and bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

### How should I store this cake after it's frosted?

Store this cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Allow the cake to come to room temperature before serving.

### Can I use a different frosting instead of the vanilla buttercream?

Yes, you can use a different frosting if you prefer. Cream cheese frosting, chocolate frosting, or whipped cream are all great options.
