## FAQ

### How long should I bake the potatoes for?

It depends on the size of the potatoes. Generally, medium-sized potatoes will take about 45-60 minutes to bake at 400°F (200°C). However, larger potatoes may take up to 90 minutes.

### Should I wrap the potatoes in foil before baking?

It's up to personal preference, but wrapping the potatoes in foil can help to keep them moist and prevent the skin from becoming too crispy. If you prefer crispy skin, bake the potatoes without foil.

### How can I tell when the potatoes are done baking?

You can check if the potatoes are done by inserting a fork or knife into the center of the potato. If it goes in easily and the potato feels soft, it's done. Alternatively, you can press the potato with your fingers - if it feels soft and gives a little, it's done.

### Can I microwave the potatoes instead of baking them?

Yes, you can microwave the potatoes for a quicker cooking time. Pierce the potatoes with a fork and microwave on high for 5-10 minutes or until they are tender. However, the texture may be slightly different compared to baked potatoes.

### Can I add toppings to the potatoes before baking?

Yes, you can add toppings like cheese, bacon, sour cream, and chives before baking. Just make sure to wrap the potatoes in foil if you add toppings to prevent them from burning.

### Do I need to wash the potatoes before baking them?

Yes, it's important to wash the potatoes before baking them to remove any dirt or debris on the skin. You can use a vegetable scrubber or just rinse them under water.

### Can I bake the potatoes ahead of time?

Yes, you can bake the potatoes ahead of time and reheat them later. Just wrap them in foil and store them in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, bake them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for 15-20 minutes or until heated through.

### How should I store leftover baked potatoes?

### Can I freeze baked potatoes?
