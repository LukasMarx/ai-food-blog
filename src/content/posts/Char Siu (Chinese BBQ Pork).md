## Variations

- **Char Siu Fried Rice:** Use the Char Siu to add flavor to fried rice! Cook some rice, then fry it up with eggs, peas, carrots, and diced Char Siu.

## FAQ

### What cut of pork is best for Char Siu?

The best cut of pork for Char Siu is pork shoulder. It has the right amount of fat to keep the meat moist and tender during cooking.

### How long should I marinate the pork for?

It is recommended to marinate the pork for at least 4 hours, but ideally overnight. This will allow the flavours to penetrate the meat and give it a delicious taste.

### Can I use honey instead of maltose in the marinade?

Yes, you can use honey instead of maltose in the marinade. However, honey is sweeter than maltose, so you may need to adjust the amount of sugar in the recipe to balance the sweetness.

### Can I use a gas grill instead of a charcoal grill?

Yes, you can use a gas grill instead of a charcoal grill. However, you may need to adjust the temperature and cooking time to ensure the pork is cooked properly.

### How do I know when the pork is fully cooked?

The pork should be cooked through and have an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). You can use a meat thermometer to check the temperature.

### Can I freeze Char Siu?

Yes, you can freeze Char Siu. It is best to freeze it in portions so that you can easily defrost and reheat it as needed.

### What can I serve with Char Siu?

Char Siu is traditionally served with steamed rice and vegetables, such as bok choy or Chinese broccoli. It can also be added to stir-fries or noodle dishes.

### How long can I store Char Siu in the refrigerator?

You can store Char Siu in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Make sure to keep it in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out.

### Can I use the marinade as a sauce?

No, you should not use the marinade as a sauce. The marinade has come into contact with raw meat and can contain harmful bacteria. Instead, you can make a separate sauce using the same ingredients, but cooking them in a saucepan before serving.

### What if I don't have Chinese five spice powder?

If you don't have Chinese five spice powder, you can make your own by combining equal parts of cinnamon, cloves, fennel seeds, star anise, and Szechuan peppercorns. Alternatively, you can omit it from the recipe, but the flavour of the Char Siu may be slightly different.
