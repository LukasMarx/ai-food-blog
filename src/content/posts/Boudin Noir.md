## Introduction

Boudin noir, also known as black pudding or blood sausage, is a traditional French dish made with pork blood, onions, and spices. While it might not sound appetizing to everyone, boudin noir is a flavorful and unique sausage that is a staple in French cuisine. In this blog post, we will share with you an easy-to-follow recipe for making boudin noir at home.

## Ingredients

To make boudin noir for 4 portions, you will need:

- 500g pork blood
- 200g onions
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp cloves
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 50ml milk
- Hog casings

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix the pork blood, finely chopped onions and garlic, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. Make sure to mix well to incorporate all the ingredients.

2. Add the breadcrumbs and milk to the bowl and mix well until you get a smooth and creamy mixture. The breadcrumbs and milk will help to bind the ingredients and give the sausage a nice texture.

3. Stuff the mixture into hog casings, making sure to tie off the ends. You can use a sausage stuffer or a piping bag to make the process easier. Make sure to fill the casings tightly, but not too much to avoid bursting.

4. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the sausages and cook for 1 hour. The sausages will float to the surface when they are cooked. Remove them from the pot and let them cool down for a few minutes.

5. Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Slice the sausages into rounds and fry them until crispy on both sides. This will give the sausage a nice texture and a crispy crust.

6. Serve the boudin noir hot, with a side of sautéed mushrooms or caramelized onions. The sausage pairs well with a glass of red wine and some crusty bread.

Boudin noir can be made in many different ways, depending on the region and the cook's preferences. Some variations include:

- Boudin blanc: A white version of the sausage made with pork or chicken meat instead of blood.
- Boudin antillais: A Caribbean version of the sausage made with pork liver, spices, and rum.
- Boudin noir aux pommes: A classic French dish made with boudin noir and sautéed apples.
