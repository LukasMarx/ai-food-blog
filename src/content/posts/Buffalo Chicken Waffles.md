## Ingredients

To make buffalo chicken waffles for four people, you will need:

- 1/3 cup vegetable oil

## Directions

## Variations

If you're looking to switch things up a bit, there are plenty of ways to customize your buffalo chicken waffles. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- **Make it vegetarian:** Swap out the chicken for a vegetarian alternative, such as tofu or seitan.
- **Make it spicier:** If you really love heat, try adding some extra hot sauce or red pepper flakes to the batter.
- **Make it milder:** If you're not a fan of spicy food, you can tone down the heat by using less buffalo sauce or swapping it out for a milder sauce.
- **Add some sweetness:** If you like a little sweetness with your savory, try drizzling some honey over the top of your finished waffles.
- **Try a different cheese:** While cheddar cheese is a classic choice for chicken and waffles, you can experiment with other types of cheese to see what you like best. Try mozzarella, pepper jack, or even blue cheese for a more pungent flavor.
