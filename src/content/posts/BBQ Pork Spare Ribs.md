## FAQ

### What is the best cut of meat for BBQ Pork Spare Ribs?

The best cut of meat for BBQ Pork Spare Ribs is St. Louis-style ribs, which are cut from the lower part of the pig's ribcage. This cut has more meat than baby back ribs and is also more flavorful.

### Should I remove the membrane from the ribs before cooking?

Yes, it is recommended to remove the membrane from the underside of the ribs before cooking. This will help the seasoning and smoke penetrate the meat more evenly and result in a more tender and flavorful rib.

### How long should I marinate the ribs before cooking?

It is recommended to marinate the ribs for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight, to enhance the flavor of the meat. You can use your favorite marinade or try a dry rub for a more intense flavor.

### What is the best way to cook BBQ Pork Spare Ribs?

The best way to cook BBQ Pork Spare Ribs is low and slow. This means cooking them at a low temperature (around 225째F) for several hours (usually 3-4 hours). You can use a smoker or grill with indirect heat and add wood chips for a smoky flavor.

### How can I tell when the ribs are done?

You can tell when the ribs are done by checking the internal temperature with a meat thermometer. The ideal temperature is between 195-205째F. Another way to check is by testing the meat's tenderness. If the meat easily pulls away from the bone, the ribs are done.

### Should I wrap the ribs in foil while cooking?

Wrapping the ribs in foil (also known as the "Texas Crutch") can help to speed up the cooking process and keep the meat moist. However, it can also result in less bark and a softer texture. It's up to personal preference.

### How should I sauce the ribs?

You can sauce the ribs during the last 30 minutes of cooking or after they're finished. Brush the sauce on the ribs and then return them to the grill or oven to caramelize the sauce. You can also serve extra sauce on the side.

### Should I let the ribs rest before serving?

Yes, it is recommended to let the ribs rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat and result in a more tender and juicy rib.

### Can I freeze leftover BBQ Pork Spare Ribs?
