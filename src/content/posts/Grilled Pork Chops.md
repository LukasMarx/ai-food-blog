Not only are they a delicious and versatile protein option, but they also cook quickly on the grill, making them perfect for busy weeknights or outdoor summer BBQs. With this simple recipe, you'll be able to make juicy and flavorful grilled pork chops every time.

## Ingredients

- 4 bone-in pork chops (about 1 inch thick)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat grill to medium-high heat.
2. In a small bowl, mix olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, thyme, salt, and black pepper.
3. Rub the mixture over both sides of the pork chops.
4. Grill the pork chops for 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F.
5. Remove from the grill and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Start by preheating your grill to medium-high heat. While the grill is heating up, prepare the pork chops by mixing together the olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, thyme, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Rub the mixture over both sides of the pork chops. 

Once the grill is hot, place the pork chops on the grill and cook for 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature. 

Once the pork chops are fully cooked, remove them from the grill and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute and ensure that the pork chops stay juicy and tender.

## Variations

- **Marinade:** For an extra burst of flavor, marinate the pork chops for at least 30 minutes before grilling. You can use a store-bought marinade or make your own by combining ingredients like soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger.
- **Spices:** Feel free to mix up the spices in the rub to suit your tastes. You can add some cumin, chili powder, or smoked paprika for a smoky flavor, or use fresh herbs like rosemary or oregano instead of thyme.
- **Sides:** Grilled pork chops pair well with a variety of sides, such as roasted vegetables, corn on the cob, or a simple green salad. You can also serve them with a flavorful sauce, like chimichurri or barbecue sauce.
