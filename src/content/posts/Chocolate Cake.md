## FAQ

### Can I use margarine instead of butter for the Chocolate Cake?

Yes, you can use margarine instead of butter, but we recommend using butter to get a richer taste and better texture.

### Can I skip the coffee in the recipe?

Yes, you can skip the coffee in the recipe, but it enhances the chocolate flavor and does not make the cake taste like coffee. You can also use decaf coffee or just water instead.

### Can I use regular sugar instead of brown sugar for the Chocolate Cake?

You can use regular sugar instead of brown sugar, but the cake will have a slightly different taste and texture. Brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel flavor that you won't get with regular sugar.

### Can I make the Chocolate Cake without eggs?

Yes, you can substitute eggs with applesauce, mashed bananas, yogurt, or silken tofu. However, the texture and taste of the cake will be different.

### How long can I store the Chocolate Cake?

You can store the Chocolate Cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

### Can I use almond flour instead of all-purpose flour for the Chocolate Cake?

You can use almond flour instead of all-purpose flour, but the texture and taste will be different. Almond flour is denser and has a nutty flavor that will alter the taste of the cake.

### Can I add nuts to the Chocolate Cake?

Yes, you can add chopped nuts like walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts to the Chocolate Cake batter before baking. They will add texture and flavor to the cake.

### How can I make the Chocolate Cake gluten-free?

You can use gluten-free flour like rice flour, corn flour, or almond flour instead of all-purpose flour. Also, make sure that all the other ingredients, like baking powder and cocoa powder, are gluten-free.

### Can I use a different frosting for the Chocolate Cake?

Yes, you can use a different frosting like cream cheese frosting, buttercream frosting, or ganache. However, make sure that the frosting complements the chocolate flavor of the cake.

### Can I make the Chocolate Cake in advance?

Yes, you can make the Chocolate Cake in advance and store it in the fridge or freezer. However, if you frost it, make sure that the frosting is set before storing it.
