## Vegetarian/Vegan Substitutions

You can replace the heavy cream with coconut cream or soy cream, and the egg yolks with cornstarch or arrowroot powder. Keep in mind that these substitutions may change the flavor and texture of the dessert.

## Flavor Variations
While the classic Crème Brûlée is delicious on its own, you can also experiment with different flavor variations to add your own personal touch. Here are some ideas:

- Chocolate: Add 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to the custard mixture and top with a chocolate ganache instead of caramelized sugar.
- Citrus: Add the zest of one lemon or orange to the custard mixture for a fresh and tangy flavor.
- Lavender: Infuse the heavy cream with dried lavender buds before adding it to the custard mixture for a floral and fragrant flavor.
- Spices: Add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, or cardamom to the custard mixture for a warm and cozy flavor.
