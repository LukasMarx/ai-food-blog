## FAQ

### Can I use salted butter instead of unsalted butter?

We recommend using unsalted butter in this recipe to control the amount of salt in the cookies. However, if you only have salted butter on hand, you can use it and omit the additional salt called for in the recipe.

### Can I use margarine instead of butter?

Margarine can be used as a substitute for butter in this recipe, but it may slightly alter the taste and texture of the cookies.

### How do I make sure my cookies are soft and chewy?

To ensure soft and chewy cookies, do not overbake them. The cookies may look underdone when you take them out of the oven, but they will continue to cook and set as they cool.

Yes, you can freeze the cookie dough for later use. Simply shape the dough into balls and place them on a baking sheet. Freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer-safe container or bag. When ready to bake, place the frozen dough balls on a baking sheet and let them thaw for about 15 minutes before baking as directed.

The cookies will stay fresh for up to 1 week when stored in an airtight container at room temperature.
