### What equipment do I need to make peanut brittle?

### Can I use a different type of nut instead of peanuts?

Yes, you can use a different type of nut instead of peanuts. Some popular alternatives include almonds, cashews, and pecans.

### Can I make peanut brittle without a candy thermometer?

While it is possible to make peanut brittle without a candy thermometer, it is not recommended. The candy thermometer ensures that the caramel reaches the correct temperature, which is essential for the candy to set properly.

### How long does peanut brittle last?

Peanut brittle can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks.

### Can I add other ingredients to peanut brittle?

Yes, you can add other ingredients to peanut brittle, such as chocolate chips, sea salt, or dried fruit. However, it is important to add these ingredients after the caramel has reached the correct temperature.

### Can I make peanut brittle in the microwave?

While it is possible to make peanut brittle in the microwave, it is not recommended. The heat is not as evenly distributed as on a stove, which can cause the candy to burn or not set properly.

### How do I know when the caramel is ready?

The caramel is ready when it reaches a temperature of 300째F on the candy thermometer. It should be a deep amber color and have a nutty aroma.

### What should I do if the caramel starts to burn?

If the caramel starts to burn, immediately remove the saucepan from the heat and pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Do not scrape the burnt caramel into the mixture, as this will cause the entire batch to taste burnt.

### Can I double the recipe?

While it is possible to double the recipe, it is not recommended. The larger batch size can be difficult to manage, and it may take longer for the caramel to reach the correct temperature. It is better to make multiple smaller batches instead.
