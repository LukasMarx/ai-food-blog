## FAQ

### What is Margherita Pizza?

Margherita pizza is a classic Italian pizza made with a simple tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves. It is named after Queen Margherita of Savoy who visited Naples in 1889 and was served a pizza that resembled the colors of the Italian flag.

### What type of flour should I use to make pizza dough for Margherita Pizza?

It is recommended to use high-protein flour, also known as bread flour, to make pizza dough for Margherita Pizza. This type of flour will give your dough a chewy texture and crispy crust.

### Can I make the pizza dough ahead of time?

Yes, you can make pizza dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. This will allow the dough to develop more flavor and make it easier to work with when you are ready to make the pizza.

### Can I use dried basil instead of fresh basil?

While fresh basil is ideal for Margherita Pizza, you can use dried basil if fresh basil is not available. However, the flavor will not be as fresh and vibrant as using fresh basil.

### Can I use pre-shredded mozzarella cheese?

While you can use pre-shredded mozzarella cheese, it is recommended to use fresh mozzarella cheese for Margherita Pizza. Fresh mozzarella cheese has a creamier texture and better flavor than pre-shredded cheese.

### Can I use a pizza stone instead of a baking sheet?

### Can I add toppings to Margherita Pizza?

While Margherita Pizza is traditionally made with just tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and basil, you can add additional toppings if desired. However, it is recommended to keep the toppings simple to allow the flavors of the tomato sauce, cheese, and basil to shine through.

### How hot should my oven be when making Margherita Pizza?

It is recommended to preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C) or as high as it will go when making Margherita Pizza. This high temperature will help create a crispy crust and melt the cheese evenly.

### Can I freeze Margherita Pizza?

### Can I make Margherita Pizza on the grill?
