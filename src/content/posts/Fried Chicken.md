## FAQ

### What is the best type of chicken to use for fried chicken?

The best type of chicken to use for fried chicken is bone-in, skin-on chicken. Thighs, legs, and wings are the best options as they have more fat and flavor than breast meat.

### How long should I marinate the chicken before frying?

It is recommended to marinate the chicken for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.

### Can I use a different flour instead of all-purpose flour?

Yes, you can use a different flour such as rice flour or cornmeal for a gluten-free option. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may be slightly different.

### Can I use a frying pan instead of a deep fryer?

Yes, you can use a frying pan instead of a deep fryer. Make sure that the oil is hot enough before adding the chicken and turn the chicken occasionally for even cooking.

### How do I know when the chicken is cooked?

The best way to know if the chicken is cooked is to use a meat thermometer. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165°F (74°C). Alternatively, you can cut into the thickest part of the chicken to check if the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear.

### How can I make sure the breading stays on the chicken?

To make sure the breading stays on the chicken, coat the chicken in flour, then dip it in an egg wash, and finally coat it in breadcrumbs. Make sure to press the breadcrumbs onto the chicken to help them stick.

### Can I make fried chicken in advance?

Yes, you can make fried chicken in advance. Let the chicken cool to room temperature, then store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days. Reheat the chicken in the oven at 350°F (177°C) for 10-15 minutes or until heated through.

### Can I use boneless chicken for fried chicken?

Yes, you can use boneless chicken for fried chicken. However, keep in mind that boneless chicken tends to cook faster than bone-in chicken, so adjust the cooking time accordingly.

### How can I make crispy fried chicken without deep-frying?
