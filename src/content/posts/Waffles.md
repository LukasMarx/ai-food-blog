3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this can result in tough waffles.
4. Heat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once hot, spray with cooking spray or brush with melted butter.

## Tips for Perfect Waffles

- Make sure your waffle iron is hot before adding the batter. This will help ensure that your waffles cook evenly and develop a crispy exterior.
