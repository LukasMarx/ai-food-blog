## FAQ

### What cut of beef should I use for the roast beef?

For the best results, we recommend using a tender cut such as ribeye, tenderloin, or sirloin. These cuts have a good amount of marbling which gives the meat a lot of flavor and helps keep it tender.

### How long should I cook the roast beef for?

This depends on the size of your roast beef and how well-done you like it. As a general rule, you should cook the beef for 20 minutes per 500g for medium-rare, 25 minutes per 500g for medium, and 30 minutes per 500g for well-done. It's always a good idea to use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the beef.

### What temperature should I cook the roast beef at?

Preheat your oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas mark 7. Once the beef is in the oven, you should reduce the temperature to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas mark 4.

### How do I make the Yorkshire puddings?

To make the Yorkshire puddings, you will need plain flour, eggs, milk, and oil. Whisk together the flour, eggs, and milk until you have a smooth batter. Preheat a muffin tin with oil in each cup. Once the oil is hot, pour in the batter and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until risen and golden.

### Can I make the Yorkshire puddings in advance?

Yorkshire puddings are best made and eaten fresh. However, you can make them in advance and reheat them in the oven at 180°C / 160°C fan / gas mark 4 for 5-10 minutes.

### Can I cook the roast beef and Yorkshire puddings at the same time?

Yes, you can cook the roast beef and Yorkshire puddings at the same time. Put the beef in the oven first for the required amount of time, then add the Yorkshire pudding batter to a preheated muffin tin and cook for 20-25 minutes until risen and golden.

### How do I make the gravy?

To make the gravy, remove the beef from the roasting tin and set aside to rest. Pour any excess fat from the tin and place the tin on the hob over a medium heat. Add some flour and stir to make a roux. Gradually add some beef stock, stirring all the time to prevent lumps. Simmer for a few minutes until the gravy thickens, then season to taste.

### Can I use beef stock cubes for the gravy?

Yes, you can use beef stock cubes for the gravy. Simply dissolve the stock cube in hot water before adding it to the roasting tin.

### How long should I let the beef rest before carving?

It's important to let the beef rest for at least 20 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, making it more tender and juicy.

### How do I carve the roast beef?

To carve the roast beef, use a sharp carving knife and cut against the grain of the meat. Start at one end of the beef and slice down to the other end, making each slice about 1cm thick.
