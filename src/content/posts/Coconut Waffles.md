## Variations

### Vegan Coconut Waffles

To make these waffles vegan, simply substitute the milk and eggs for plant-based alternatives. Use almond milk or coconut milk in place of cow's milk, and flax eggs or applesauce in place of eggs. The end result will be just as delicious, and you can enjoy your waffles knowing they're 100% vegan.

### Gluten-Free Coconut Waffles

For a gluten-free version of these waffles, swap out the all-purpose flour for a gluten-free flour blend. You can also use almond flour or coconut flour if you prefer. Just keep in mind that the texture may be slightly different, but they'll still be delicious.

### Savory Coconut Waffles

If you're not in the mood for a sweet breakfast, try making these waffles with a savory twist. Omit the sugar and vanilla extract, and add some garlic powder, onion powder, and chopped herbs to the batter instead. Top with avocado, salsa, and a fried egg for a delicious and filling brunch.

Coconut waffles are the perfect way to add a little tropical flair to your breakfast routine. With just a few simple ingredients, you can create a delicious and satisfying meal that will transport you to a sunny beach with every bite. So go ahead, whip up a batch of these waffles and start your day off right!
