## Ingredients

- 4 pieces of white fish fillet (about 500g)
- 12 corn tortillas
- 1 red onion, diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- 1 tbsp of chili powder
- 1 tsp of cumin powder
- 1/2 tsp of paprika
- 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper
- 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup of sour cream
- 1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 lime, cut into wedges
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper. Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes or until cooked through. Let cool and shred the fish with a fork.
3. In a large skillet, sauté the onion and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt to taste. Cook for 10 minutes or until the sauce has thickened.
4. Add the shredded fish to the tomato sauce and mix well.
5. Warm the tortillas in the microwave or on a skillet until pliable. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the fish mixture onto each tortilla and roll tightly. Place the enchiladas seam side down in a baking dish. Repeat until all the tortillas and fish mixture are used up.
6. Pour any remaining tomato sauce over the enchiladas and sprinkle with the grated cheese.
7. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve hot with sour cream, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges on the side.

## Vegetarian/Vegan Variation

To make this recipe vegetarian/vegan, you can replace the fish with tofu or tempeh. Simply drain the tofu or tempeh and dice it into small pieces. Sauté it with the onion and garlic until browned and crispy. Follow the rest of the recipe as written, but omit the cheese and sour cream. Instead, top the enchiladas with avocado slices and a dollop of vegan sour cream.

## Gluten-Free Variation

This recipe is already gluten-free, but make sure to check the labels of all the ingredients you use to ensure they are also gluten-free. Some brands of corn tortillas may contain wheat flour as a filler, so be sure to read the ingredients list carefully.

## Low-Carb Variation

To make this recipe low-carb, you can use low-carb tortillas made from almond flour or coconut flour. These tortillas are usually higher in protein and lower in carbs than traditional corn tortillas. You can also reduce the amount of tortillas used and increase the amount of fish to make the enchiladas more protein-packed.

## Final thoughts

Fish enchiladas are a great way to enjoy the flavors of Mexican cuisine while also getting a healthy dose of protein and nutrients. This recipe is easy to make and can be customized to fit any dietary needs or preferences. Whether you're a meat eater, vegetarian, gluten-free, or low-carb, you can enjoy this delicious and nutritious meal. So why not give it a try tonight?
