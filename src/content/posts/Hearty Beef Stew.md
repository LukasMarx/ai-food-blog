## Ingredients

- 2 lbs beef chuck, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups beef broth
- 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 4 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1.  Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the beef and brown on all sides, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pot. Remove the beef and set aside.
2.  Add the onion and garlic to the pot and saut√© until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
3.  Pour in the beef broth and diced tomatoes, and stir to combine. Add the thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, and beef, and bring the mixture to a boil.
4.  Reduce the heat to low and let the stew simmer, covered, for 1 hour.
5.  Add the carrots, potatoes, and celery, and continue to simmer until the vegetables are tender and the beef is cooked through, about 30 minutes more.
6.  Season the stew with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the bay leaves and serve hot.

For a heartier meal, you can serve this beef stew over a bed of rice or mashed potatoes. You can also garnish it with some chopped parsley or cilantro for a pop of color and freshness.

If you have any leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days. The flavors of the stew will continue to develop and intensify over time, making it even more delicious the next day.

This beef stew is also a great make-ahead meal that you can freeze for later. Simply cool the stew completely, then transfer it to a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag and freeze for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw the stew overnight in the fridge, then transfer it to a pot and heat it over medium-low heat until warmed through.
