## FAQ

### Can I make the dough ahead of time?

Yes, you can make the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days before baking. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.

### What if I don't have a stand mixer?

If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer or even mix the dough by hand with a wooden spoon. Just be sure to knead the dough well to ensure that it is smooth and elastic.

While you can use margarine instead of butter, we recommend using butter for the best flavor and texture. Margarine may also contain more water, which can affect the consistency of the dough.
