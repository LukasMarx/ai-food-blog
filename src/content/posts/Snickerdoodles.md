## FAQ

### What are snickerdoodles?

Snickerdoodles are a type of cookie made with cream of tartar and rolled in cinnamon sugar before baking. They have a slightly tangy flavor and a soft, chewy texture.

### Can I make snickerdoodles without cream of tartar?

Cream of tartar is an essential ingredient in snickerdoodles, as it gives the cookies their signature tangy flavor and soft texture. If you don't have cream of tartar, you can try substituting baking powder, but the cookies will have a slightly different taste and texture.

### Can I use margarine instead of butter in snickerdoodles?

While you can technically use margarine instead of butter in snickerdoodles, we recommend sticking with butter for the best flavor and texture. Margarine has a higher water content, which can make the cookies spread too much and become greasy.

### How long do snickerdoodles keep?

Snickerdoodles can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months.

### Can I freeze snickerdoodle dough?

Yes, you can freeze snickerdoodle dough for up to 3 months. Form the dough into balls and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Freeze the dough balls until solid, then transfer them to a freezer bag. When you're ready to bake the cookies, roll the frozen dough balls in cinnamon sugar and bake as usual.

### Can I make snickerdoodles without cinnamon sugar?

Cinnamon sugar is a key component of snickerdoodles, so we don't recommend leaving it out. However, you can experiment with other coatings like powdered sugar or cocoa powder if you want to mix things up.

### Do I need to chill the dough before baking?

No, you don't need to chill the dough before baking snickerdoodles. However, if you find that your cookies are spreading too much during baking, you can try chilling the dough for 30 minutes before scooping and rolling.

### Can I make snickerdoodles with whole wheat flour?

Yes, you can use whole wheat flour in snickerdoodles, but the cookies will have a denser texture and a more pronounced wheat flavor. If you want to use whole wheat flour, we recommend substituting half of the all-purpose flour called for in the recipe.

### Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to snickerdoodles?

Yes, you can add nuts or chocolate chips to snickerdoodles if you like. Simply stir them into the dough after mixing in the flour.

### Can I make snickerdoodles vegan?

Yes, you can make vegan snickerdoodles by substituting vegan butter or coconut oil for the butter, and using a flax egg or applesauce instead of the egg. You'll also need to make sure your cream of tartar is vegan (some brands are derived from grapes).
