Guacamole is a classic Mexican dish that is loved by many for its fresh, creamy, and tangy flavors. It's a versatile dish that can be served as a dip, spread, or topping for various dishes such as tacos, burritos, sandwiches, and salads.

Making guacamole at home is easy and requires only a handful of fresh ingredients. Here's how to make it:

## Ingredients

- 2 ripe avocados
- 1/4 cup diced red onion
- 1 small jalape単o pepper, seeded and minced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1.  Cut the avocados in half and remove the pit. Scoop the flesh into a medium bowl and mash it with a fork or a potato masher until it's slightly chunky.
2.  Add the diced red onion, minced jalape単o pepper, minced garlic, lime juice, ground cumin, salt, and black pepper to the bowl.
3.  Stir everything together until well combined.
4.  Taste the guacamole and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you want it spicier, you can add more jalape単o pepper. If you want it tangier, you can add more lime juice.
5.  Stir in the chopped cilantro.
6.  Transfer the guacamole to a serving bowl and garnish it with additional cilantro, if desired.

That's it! Your homemade guacamole is now ready to be enjoyed. Serve it with tortilla chips, sliced vegetables, or as a topping for your favorite dishes. This recipe makes about 1 1/2 cups of guacamole, but you can easily double or triple the recipe if you're feeding a crowd.

Guacamole is best eaten fresh, but you can store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a day. To prevent browning, press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the guacamole before covering it with the lid. Enjoy!
