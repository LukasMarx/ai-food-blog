## Vegetarian/Vegan Variation

If you're a vegetarian or vegan, you can still enjoy the flavors of a savory pie by replacing the beef and kidney with mushrooms and lentils. Use the same recipe for the crust, but for the filling:

- 500g mushrooms, sliced
- 200g green or brown lentils
- 2 onions, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp flour
- 400ml vegetable stock
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

Follow the same instructions as above, but cook the lentils separately according to package instructions and add them to the mushroom mixture once it's cooked.
