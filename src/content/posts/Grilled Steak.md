## Why Grilled Steak is a Great Idea

Grilled steak is a classic American dish that is perfect for entertaining guests, celebrating special occasions, or even just for a weeknight dinner. This recipe is easy to make and results in a deliciously juicy and flavorful steak. Plus, grilling is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and the warm weather during the summer months.

## Ingredients

- 4 ribeye steaks (1 1/2 inches thick)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tbsp black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat grill to high heat.
2. Rub the steaks with olive oil and season with kosher salt and black pepper.
3. Place the steaks on the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 135°F for medium-rare.
4. Remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

To ensure the perfect steak, it's important to let the steak rest before slicing into it. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the steak, resulting in a more tender and flavorful piece of meat.

## Variations

### Garlic Butter Grilled Steak

For an extra flavor boost, try adding garlic butter to your grilled steak. Simply make a garlic butter by combining 1/2 cup softened butter with 3 minced garlic cloves, 1 tbsp chopped parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread the garlic butter over the hot grilled steaks and let it melt over the top.

### Grilled Steak Salad

If you're looking for a lighter way to enjoy your grilled steak, try making a grilled steak salad. Simply grill your steak as usual, then slice it thinly and add it to a bed of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, sliced red onion, and your favorite salad dressing.

### Grilled Steak Tacos

For a fun and flavorful twist on traditional tacos, try using grilled steak as your protein. Simply grill the steak as usual, slice it thinly, and serve it in warm tortillas with toppings like diced tomatoes, sliced avocado, shredded cheese, and salsa.

## FAQ

### What type of steak is best for grilling?

The best steaks for grilling are those that are well-marbled and have a good amount of fat, such as ribeye, sirloin, or New York strip.

### How should I season the steak before grilling?

You can season the steak with a simple mixture of salt, pepper, and garlic powder, or use your favorite steak seasoning blend. Make sure to rub the seasoning into the meat and let it rest for at least 30 minutes before grilling.

### How long should I grill the steak for?

The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the steak and how well-done you prefer it. As a general rule, you should grill the steak for 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, 5-6 minutes per side for medium, and 6-7 minutes per side for well-done.

### Should I let the steak rest before serving?

### Can I use a gas grill instead of a charcoal grill?

Yes, you can use a gas grill instead of a charcoal grill. Just make sure to preheat the grill to high heat before adding the steak.

You can use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak. For medium-rare, the temperature should be 135°F, for medium it should be 145°F, and for well-done it should be 160°F. Alternatively, you can use the finger test to check the doneness of the steak.

### Should I oil the grill grates before grilling the steak?
