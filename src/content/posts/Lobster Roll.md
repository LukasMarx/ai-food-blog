Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add the lobster and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the shell turns bright red. Remove the lobster from the water and let it cool before removing the meat from the shell.

### Can I use a different type of bread for the roll?

Yes, you can use a different type of bread for the roll. However, traditional New England-style hot dog buns work best because they are split from the top and can be easily grilled or toasted.
