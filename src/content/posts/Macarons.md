## FAQ

### What are macarons?

Macarons are a type of French pastry made from ground almonds, egg whites, and sugar. They are known for their crispy exterior and soft interior, as well as their variety of colors and flavors.

### Can I make macarons without almond flour?

Almond flour is a key ingredient in macarons, as it gives them their signature texture and flavor. While you can try substituting other types of flour, such as hazelnut or pistachio, for the almond flour, the results may not be as successful.

### Why do my macarons crack?

There are several reasons why macarons may crack during baking, including overmixing the batter, not letting the macarons rest before baking, or baking at too high of a temperature. It may take a few tries to get the perfect macaron, so don't give up!

### Can I make macarons without a piping bag?

While a piping bag is recommended for making macarons, you can try using a zip-top bag with the corner snipped off as a makeshift piping bag. However, the results may not be as precise.

### How long do macarons keep?

Macarons can keep for up to a week in the refrigerator, or up to a month in the freezer (if stored properly in an airtight container).

### Can I make macarons in advance?

Yes, you can make macarons in advance. In fact, they may even taste better after being stored in the refrigerator for a day or two. Just be sure to store them properly in an airtight container.

### How do I get my macarons to be the same size?

Using a piping bag with a round tip will help ensure that your macarons are the same size. You can also use a template to trace circles onto your parchment paper to guide your piping.

### Can I use liquid food coloring to color my macarons?

Liquid food coloring can throw off the consistency of your macaron batter, so it is best to use gel or powdered food coloring instead. These types of coloring will not add excess moisture to your batter.

### Can I fill my macarons with anything other than buttercream?

While buttercream is a classic filling for macarons, you can experiment with other flavors and fillings. Try ganache, fruit curd, or even Nutella for a delicious twist on the classic macaron.

### Why are my macarons hollow?

Hollow macarons are often the result of undermixing the batter or baking at too low of a temperature. Be sure to mix the batter until it is smooth and shiny, and bake at the correct temperature according to your recipe.
