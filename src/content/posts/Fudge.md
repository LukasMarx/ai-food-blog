## FAQ

### What is fudge?

### Can I use margarine instead of butter?

We recommend using butter for the best flavor and texture, but you can use margarine as a substitute if you prefer.

### Can I make fudge without a candy thermometer?

While using a candy thermometer is recommended for accuracy, you can make fudge without one by using the soft ball stage method. This involves dropping a small amount of the mixture into cold water and checking if it forms a soft ball.

### Can I add nuts or other ingredients to my fudge?

Yes, you can add nuts, chocolate chips, or other ingredients to your fudge for added flavor and texture. Simply fold them into the mixture before pouring it into the pan to set.

### How long does fudge take to set?

Fudge typically takes 2-4 hours to set at room temperature, depending on the recipe and the size of the pan. You can also speed up the process by refrigerating the fudge for about an hour.

### How should I store my fudge?

Fudge should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, you can freeze fudge for up to 3 months.

### Can I make fudge without using condensed milk?

Yes, you can make fudge without using condensed milk by using a combination of sugar, cream, and butter. However, this method may require more time and attention to achieve the right texture.

### Can I use a microwave to make fudge?

Yes, you can make fudge in the microwave by melting the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and stirring every 30 seconds until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

### Can I make fudge without using a stove or microwave?

While it may be possible to make fudge using alternative methods such as a slow cooker or pressure cooker, we recommend using a stove or microwave for the best results and control over the cooking process.

### Can I make fudge with alternative sweeteners?

While it may be possible to make fudge with alternative sweeteners such as honey or maple syrup, the texture and flavor may be different from traditional fudge. It's best to follow a recipe specifically designed for alternative sweeteners.
