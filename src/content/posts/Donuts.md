Donuts are a classic sweet treat that are perfect for any occasion, from breakfast to dessert. While store-bought donuts can be delicious, there's nothing quite like the taste of a freshly fried homemade donut. With this easy recipe, you can make your own donuts at home and impress your family and friends with your baking skills.

## Ingredients

For this recipe, you will need:

- 300g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 200ml milk
- 60g unsalted butter
- 50g granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- oil for frying
- 100g powdered sugar

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and instant yeast. Mix well.

2. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and butter over low heat until the butter is melted. Remove from heat.

3. Add the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract to the milk mixture. Stir well.

4. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and stir until a dough forms.

5. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.

6. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.

7. After the dough has risen, roll it out on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thickness. Use a donut cutter or two round cookie cutters to cut out donuts.

8. Heat oil in a large pot or deep fryer to 375째F. Carefully drop the donuts into the hot oil and fry for about 1-2 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to remove the donuts from the hot oil and place them on a wire rack to cool.

## Variations

While classic donuts are delicious on their own, there are many ways to customize this recipe to suit your taste preferences. Here are a few ideas:

- Glazed donuts: Instead of dusting the donuts with powdered sugar, make a simple glaze by mixing powdered sugar with a little bit of milk and vanilla extract. Dip the cooled donuts in the glaze and let them dry on a wire rack.
- Chocolate donuts: Add 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to the flour mixture to make chocolate donuts. You can also make a chocolate glaze by mixing powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and milk.
- Filled donuts: Use a piping bag to fill the donuts with your favorite filling, such as jam or pastry cream, before dusting them with powdered sugar or glazing them.
- Vegan donuts: Use non-dairy milk and vegan butter in the recipe, and replace the eggs with a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water).
