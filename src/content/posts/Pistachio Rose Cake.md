## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan)/350°F/gas mark 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8inch cake tins with baking paper.

2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and caster sugar until pale and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.

3. Fold in the self-raising flour, ground pistachios, and rose water until the mixture is smooth and well combined.
