## FAQ

### What is Cacio e Pepe?

Cacio e Pepe is a classic Italian pasta dish made with spaghetti, Pecorino Romano cheese, black pepper, and olive oil.

### Can I use Parmesan cheese instead of Pecorino Romano?

While Pecorino Romano cheese is the traditional cheese used in Cacio e Pepe, you can substitute it with Parmesan cheese if you can't find Pecorino Romano.

### Can I use any type of pasta for Cacio e Pepe?

Traditionally, spaghetti is used for Cacio e Pepe, but you can use any type of pasta you prefer, such as bucatini or linguine.

### Can I use pre-shredded cheese for this recipe?

It's best to use freshly grated cheese for this recipe as it melts better than pre-shredded cheese and will give you a creamier sauce.

### How do I prevent the cheese from clumping together?

To prevent the cheese from clumping together, remove the pan from the heat before adding the cheese and stir it in slowly and continuously until it has melted and combined with the pasta water.

### Can I add other ingredients to this recipe?

While Cacio e Pepe is traditionally made with just spaghetti, cheese, pepper, and olive oil, you can add other ingredients such as bacon or mushrooms to give it a twist.

### Can I make Cacio e Pepe ahead of time?

Cacio e Pepe is best served fresh, but you can make the cheese sauce ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When ready to serve, reheat the sauce in a pan and toss it with freshly cooked pasta.

### How do I reheat leftover Cacio e Pepe?

To reheat leftover Cacio e Pepe, add a splash of pasta water to a pan, add the leftover pasta and sauce, and toss until heated through. The pasta water will help to loosen the sauce and prevent it from sticking together.

### Can I freeze Cacio e Pepe?

We do not recommend freezing Cacio e Pepe as the texture of the cheese sauce may change when thawed.

### What wine pairs well with Cacio e Pepe?

A dry white wine such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc pairs well with Cacio e Pepe as it helps to cut through the richness of the cheese sauce.
