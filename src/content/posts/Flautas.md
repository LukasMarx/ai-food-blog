## Why Flautas are a Great Idea

Flautas are a delicious and crispy Mexican dish that are perfect for a family dinner or a party snack. They are made by filling corn tortillas with a savory mixture of shredded chicken, cheese, onions, and cilantro, and then rolling them tightly and frying them until they are golden brown and crispy. Flautas are easy to make and can be customized with your favorite toppings like guacamole, sour cream, or salsa.

## Ingredients

To make 10 flautas, you will need the following ingredients:

- 10 corn tortillas
- 2 cups of shredded chicken
- 1/2 cup of shredded cheese
- 1/2 cup of chopped onion
- 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper

## Cooking Steps

1. In a large bowl, mix the shredded chicken with the shredded cheese, chopped onion, chopped cilantro, olive oil, salt, and black pepper.

2. Heat the tortillas in the microwave for about 30 seconds to make them soft and pliable.

3. Place a few tablespoons of the chicken mixture in the center of each tortilla and roll tightly.

4. Heat some oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

5. Place the flautas seam-side down in the hot oil and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.

6. Remove the flautas from the skillet and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.

## Vegetarian Flautas

To make vegetarian flautas, simply substitute the shredded chicken with cooked and mashed black beans or refried beans. You can also add some diced peppers, jalapeños, or corn for extra flavor and texture.

## Baked Flautas

If you prefer a healthier version of this dish, you can bake the flautas instead of frying them. Preheat your oven to 400°F, brush the flautas with a little bit of oil or melted butter, and bake them on a baking sheet for about 15-20 minutes, turning them halfway through, until they are crispy and golden brown.

## Conclusion

Flautas are a delicious and easy to make Mexican dish that everyone will love. Whether you serve them as a party snack or a family dinner, they are sure to be a hit. Customize them with your favorite toppings and enjoy the crispy and savory flavors of this classic dish.
