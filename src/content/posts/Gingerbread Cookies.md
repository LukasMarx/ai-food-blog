## FAQ

### Can I replace molasses with honey or maple syrup in this recipe?

While it is possible to replace molasses with honey or maple syrup, keep in mind that it will change the flavor and texture of the cookies. Molasses provides a distinct flavor and a chewy texture that may not be achieved with other substitutes.

### Do I need to chill the dough before baking?

Yes, it is recommended to chill the dough for at least an hour before baking. Chilling the dough helps to prevent spreading and ensures the cookies keep their shape during baking.

### Can I freeze the dough?

Yes, you can freeze the dough for up to a month. Make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or put it in an airtight container before freezing. When ready to bake, thaw the dough in the refrigerator overnight before rolling and cutting.

### Can I use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour?

You can substitute some or all of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour, but keep in mind that it will change the texture and flavor of the cookies. Whole wheat flour has more fiber and less gluten, which may result in a denser and less chewy cookie.

### How do I know when the cookies are done baking?

The cookies are done baking when the edges are firm and the centers are slightly soft to the touch. They will continue to firm up as they cool on the baking sheet.

### Can I use margarine instead of butter?

While it is possible to use margarine instead of butter, keep in mind that it will affect the flavor and texture of the cookies. Butter provides a rich and buttery flavor, while margarine may result in a more artificial flavor and texture.

### Can I use a cookie scoop instead of rolling the dough?

Yes, you can use a cookie scoop to portion the dough onto the baking sheet. This will result in more uniform cookies and may save time.

### Can I add other spices to the dough?

Yes, you can add other spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves to the dough to enhance the flavor. However, keep in mind that it may alter the taste and texture of the cookies.

### How should I store the cookies?

Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. You can also freeze them in an airtight container for up to a month. Make sure to separate the layers with parchment paper to prevent sticking. 

### Can I decorate the cookies with icing?

Yes, you can decorate the cookies with icing after they have cooled completely. Use a piping bag or a plastic bag with a small hole cut out of the corner to pipe the icing onto the cookies. Allow the icing to dry completely before storing or serving.
