## FAQ

### Can I substitute the pumpkin puree with fresh pumpkin?

Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree. Roast the pumpkin in the oven until it is soft, and then remove the skin and puree the flesh in a blender or food processor.

### How do I prevent the crust from getting soggy?

To prevent the crust from getting soggy, blind-bake it before adding the filling. To do this, line the crust with parchment paper or aluminum foil, and fill it with pie weights or dry beans. Bake for about 15 minutes, remove the weights and parchment paper, and then bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the crust is lightly golden.

### Can I use a different type of pie crust?

Yes, you can use a different type of pie crust, such as a graham cracker crust or a gluten-free crust. Just make sure to adjust the baking time and temperature accordingly, as different crusts may require different baking times.

### Can I use a different type of milk instead of evaporated milk?

Yes, you can use a different type of milk, such as whole milk or heavy cream. However, using evaporated milk will give the pie a creamier texture and richer flavor.

### Can I make this pie ahead of time?

Yes, you can make this pie ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Alternatively, you can freeze the pie for up to 2 months and thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.

### Can I use a different type of spice instead of pumpkin spice?

Yes, you can use a different type of spice, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or allspice. However, pumpkin spice will give the pie the classic flavor that is associated with pumpkin pie.

### Can I use a different type of sweetener instead of sugar?

Yes, you can use a different type of sweetener, such as honey or maple syrup. However, using sugar will give the pie the classic sweetness that is associated with pumpkin pie.

### How do I know when the pie is done?

The pie is done when the filling is set but still slightly jiggly in the center. To test this, gently shake the pie and look for a slight jiggle in the center. If the pie is overcooked, the filling will crack and become dry.

### Can I make this pie without eggs?

No, eggs are a crucial ingredient in pumpkin pie, as they help to bind the filling together and give it a smooth texture. There are vegan pumpkin pie recipes that use alternative ingredients to replace the eggs, such as silken tofu or cornstarch.

### Can I decorate the pie with whipped cream?

Yes, whipped cream is a classic topping for pumpkin pie. To make whipped cream, beat heavy cream with a whisk or an electric mixer until it forms soft peaks. Add sugar and vanilla extract to taste, and then spread the whipped cream on top of the cooled pie.
