## Variations

- Vegan chocolate raspberry cake: Use vegan butter, almond milk, and vegan chocolate chips instead of the dairy-based ingredients listed in the recipe.
- Gluten-free chocolate raspberry cake: Use a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour to make this recipe gluten-free.
- White chocolate raspberry cake: Substitute white chocolate chips for the dark chocolate chips in this recipe for a sweeter flavor.
- Raspberry cream cheese frosting: Instead of chocolate frosting, try frosting the cake with a raspberry cream cheese frosting for a tangy twist.

## Tips for Making the Perfect Chocolate Raspberry Cake

- Use room temperature ingredients for best results. This will ensure that the batter mixes together smoothly and evenly.
- Don't overmix the batter. Overmixing can cause the cake to become tough and dry.
- Use fresh raspberries for the best flavor. Frozen raspberries can be used in a pinch, but they may release too much moisture and affect the texture of the cake.
- Let the cakes cool completely before frosting. If the cakes are even slightly warm, the frosting can melt and slide off the cake.
- For a more decadent cake, add extra chocolate chips or drizzle melted chocolate over the top of the cake before serving.
