## FAQ

### Can I use salted butter for the pie crust?

It is recommended to use unsalted butter for the pie crust to have better control over the saltiness of the crust. If you only have salted butter, you can use it, but reduce the amount of added salt accordingly.

### Can I substitute corn syrup with a different sweetener?

Corn syrup is an essential ingredient in pecan pie, but you can substitute it with other sweeteners like maple syrup, honey, or agave nectar. However, keep in mind that the taste and texture of the pie may differ slightly.

### Do I need to toast the pecans before adding them to the pie filling?

Toasting the pecans before adding them to the pie filling is not necessary, but it can enhance their flavor and texture. Simply spread the pecans in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 8-10 minutes at 350°F, stirring occasionally.

### Can I make the pie crust in advance?

Yes, you can make the pie crust in advance and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw the frozen crust in the fridge overnight before using.

### How do I know when the pie is done baking?

The pie is done baking when the filling is set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center. It should also be golden brown on top. The baking time may vary depending on your oven, but it usually takes about 50-60 minutes.

### Can I use a store-bought pie crust instead of making my own?

Yes, you can use a store-bought pie crust instead of making your own. However, homemade pie crust tastes better and is easy to make, so it's worth trying if you have the time.

### Do I need to refrigerate the pie after baking?

Yes, you should refrigerate the pie after baking to prevent it from spoiling. Cover it with plastic wrap or foil and store it in the fridge for up to 4 days.

### Can I freeze the pie?

Yes, you can freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly with plastic wrap or foil and place it in an airtight container or freezer bag. Thaw the frozen pie in the fridge overnight before serving.

### Can I add chocolate to the pecan pie filling?

Yes, you can add chocolate to the pecan pie filling to make it even more decadent. Simply chop some chocolate into small pieces and sprinkle it over the bottom of the pie crust before adding the pecan filling.

### How can I prevent the crust from getting soggy?

To prevent the crust from getting soggy, you can blind bake it before adding the filling. Simply prick the bottom of the crust with a fork, line it with parchment paper or aluminum foil, and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake it in the oven for about 15 minutes, then remove the weights and bake for another 5-10 minutes until it's lightly golden brown.
