## FAQ

### What is the best cut of meat to use for fajitas?

### Can I use chicken instead of beef for fajitas?

### Can I make fajitas in advance?

Yes, you can make fajitas in advance. Cook the meat and vegetables, and store them in separate containers in the refrigerator. Reheat them in a pan or the microwave before serving. Warm the tortillas in the oven or on a griddle.

### What toppings should I serve with fajitas?

### Can I make fajitas without a grill?

Yes, you can make fajitas without a grill. Heat a large skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated meat and cook until browned and cooked through. Remove the meat and add sliced onions and peppers to the same pan. Cook until they are tender and slightly charred.

### How do I make homemade fajita seasoning?

To make homemade fajita seasoning, combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Mix well and store in an airtight container. Use this seasoning to marinate the meat or sprinkle it over the vegetables while cooking.

### Can I use flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas?

### How do I slice the meat for fajitas?

To slice the meat for fajitas, place the skirt steak on a cutting board and slice it against the grain into thin strips. This will make the meat more tender and easier to chew. If you're using chicken, slice it into thin strips as well.

### Can I use a bottled fajita marinade?

Yes, you can use a bottled fajita marinade instead of making your own. However, keep in mind that bottled marinades may contain high amounts of sodium and preservatives. Look for a marinade with natural ingredients and no added sugars or artificial flavors.

### How do I prevent the tortillas from getting soggy?

To prevent the tortillas from getting soggy, warm them up in the oven or on a griddle before serving. This will make them more pliable and less likely to tear or fall apart. You can also wrap them in aluminum foil to keep them warm while you're serving the fajitas.
