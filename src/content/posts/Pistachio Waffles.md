## FAQ

### Can I use roasted and salted pistachios instead of unsalted pistachios?

It is best to use unsalted pistachios for this recipe in order to control the salt content of the waffles. If you only have roasted and salted pistachios, you can rinse them with cold water to remove some of the salt before using them.

### Can I make the batter ahead of time?

Yes, you can make the batter ahead of time and store it in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Just give it a good stir before using it to make the waffles.

### Do I need a waffle maker to make these waffles?

Yes, you will need a waffle maker to make these waffles. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for your specific waffle maker to cook the waffles to perfection.

### Can I substitute the pistachios with another nut?

Yes, you can substitute the pistachios with another nut of your choice, such as almonds or pecans. Just make sure to adjust the amount of sugar and salt in the recipe to your taste.

### Can I freeze the waffles?

Yes, you can freeze the waffles for up to 2 months. Let them cool completely, then wrap each waffle individually in plastic wrap and store them in a resealable freezer bag. To reheat, just pop them in the toaster or oven until heated through.

### What toppings can I put on my pistachio waffles?

You can top your pistachio waffles with a variety of toppings, such as fresh berries, whipped cream, maple syrup, or even a scoop of ice cream for a decadent dessert.

### Can I make this recipe vegan?

Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by substituting the milk with a plant-based milk, such as almond or soy milk, and using a flax egg instead of a regular egg.

### Can I use a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour?

Yes, you can use a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour to make these waffles gluten-free. Just make sure to use a blend that is suitable for baking.

### Can I make these waffles without sugar?

Yes, you can make these waffles without sugar, but they may not be as sweet as the original recipe. You can try adding a natural sweetener, such as honey or maple syrup, to the batter instead.
