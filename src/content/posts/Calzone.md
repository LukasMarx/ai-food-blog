## Why Calzone?

Calzone is essentially a folded pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. The word "calzone" means "trouser leg" in Italian, and it's believed that the dish got its name from the way it's folded to resemble a folded pant leg. While pizza is usually eaten with a knife and fork, calzones are meant to be eaten by hand, making them a perfect meal or snack for on-the-go.

Calzones are a great way to use up leftover pizza toppings or to experiment with new combinations. They're also customizable to fit different dietary restrictions, such as a vegetarian or vegan filling.
