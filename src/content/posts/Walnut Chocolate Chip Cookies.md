## FAQ

### Can I use a different type of nut instead of walnuts?

Yes, you can use any type of nut you prefer or have on hand, such as pecans or almonds. Just make sure to chop them into small pieces before adding them to the cookie dough.

### Can I use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate chips?

Absolutely! You can use any type of chocolate chips you prefer, or even a combination of different types. Just keep in mind that milk chocolate chips will give the cookies a sweeter taste compared to dark chocolate chips.

### Can I use margarine instead of butter?

You can use margarine instead of butter, but keep in mind that the cookies may have a slightly different texture and taste. Butter has a higher fat content than margarine, which can affect the cookies' texture and spread.

### How long do these cookies stay fresh?

These cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. If you want to keep them fresh longer, you can freeze them for up to 3 months.

### Can I refrigerate the cookie dough before baking?

Yes, you can refrigerate the cookie dough for up to 24 hours before baking. This can help the flavors develop and also prevent the cookies from spreading too much while baking.

### How many cookies does this recipe make?

This recipe makes about 20-24 cookies, depending on the size of the dough balls you scoop.

### Can I add other mix-ins to the cookie dough?

Yes, you can add other mix-ins to the cookie dough, such as dried fruit or shredded coconut. Just keep in mind that adding too many mix-ins can affect the cookies' texture and spread.

### Can I make these cookies gluten-free?

Yes, you can make these cookies gluten-free by using a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour. You can also find gluten-free oats and chocolate chips to use in the recipe.

### Can I use a cookie scoop instead of rolling the dough into balls?

Yes, using a cookie scoop is a great way to ensure that all the cookies are the same size and shape. Just make sure to flatten the dough balls slightly with your fingers before baking.

### Can I substitute honey for the granulated sugar?

While honey can be used as a sweetener in baking, it may affect the cookies' texture and spread. It's best to stick with granulated sugar for this recipe.
