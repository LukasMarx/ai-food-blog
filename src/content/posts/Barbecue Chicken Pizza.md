- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 cups cooked and shredded chicken
- 1/2 cup barbecue sauce
- 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced

## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the pizza dough

In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour mixture and stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough for 5 minutes and let it rest for 10 minutes.

### Step 2: Prepare the pizza toppings

Add the shredded chicken and sliced red onion on top of the cheese.

### Step 3: Bake the pizza

Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing it. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve.

## Variations

If you're looking for a vegetarian or vegan option, you can easily make this pizza without the chicken. Simply replace the chicken with your favorite vegetables, such as sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, or zucchini.

For a spicier version of this pizza, add some sliced jalapeños or red pepper flakes on top of the cheese before baking.

If you're short on time, you can use a pre-made pizza crust instead of making your own dough. Just follow the instructions on the package and add the barbecue sauce, cheese, chicken, and onion on top before baking.

## Conclusion
