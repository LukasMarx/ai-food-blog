## Ingredients

- 2 duck breasts, skin on
- 2 tbsp honey
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 200°C.
2. Using a sharp knife, score the skin of the duck breasts in a criss-cross pattern, making sure not to cut through to the meat.
3. Season the duck breasts generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
4. Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add the duck breasts, skin-side down, and cook for 5-7 minutes, until the skin is crispy and golden brown.
5. Flip the duck breasts over and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast for 10-12 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 60°C for medium-rare.
6. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the honey, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, and minced garlic.

8. Drizzle the honey-soy sauce mixture over the sliced duck breasts and serve immediately.

## Variations

- **Orange Sauce:** Instead of the honey-soy sauce mixture, make a classic French orange sauce by whisking together 1/2 cup orange juice, 2 tbsp honey, 2 tbsp red wine vinegar, and 1 tbsp Dijon mustard. Simmer in a saucepan until thickened and serve over the sliced duck breasts.
- **Herb-Crusted:** Mix together 1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley) with 1/4 cup breadcrumbs and 1 tbsp olive oil. Press the herb mixture onto the skin of the duck breasts before searing and roasting.
- **Vegetarian/Vegan:** For a vegetarian/vegan version, substitute the duck breasts with seitan or tofu and follow the same cooking instructions. Use agave nectar instead of honey and tamari instead of soy sauce for the sauce.
