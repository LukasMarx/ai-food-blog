### Step 6: Make the caramel sauce

While the cake is baking, prepare the caramel sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and heavy cream and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for 5-7 minutes, until it thickens slightly. Stir in the vanilla extract.

## Variations

- **Vegan version:** To make this cake vegan, replace the eggs with 2 flax eggs (2 tablespoons ground flaxseed mixed with 6 tablespoons water) and replace the milk with almond milk or another plant-based milk of your choice. Use vegan butter and cream in the caramel sauce.
- **Gluten-free version:** To make this cake gluten-free, replace the all-purpose flour with a gluten-free flour blend.
- **Individual servings:** Instead of making one large cake, you can make individual servings by pouring the batter into muffin tins and adjusting the baking time accordingly.
- **Apple crisp topping:** For an extra crunch, sprinkle an apple crisp topping over the caramel sauce. To make the topping, mix 1/2 cup oats, 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter together. Sprinkle the mixture over the caramel sauce before serving.
