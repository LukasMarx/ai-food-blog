## Introduction

Steamed rice is a staple in many cultures and cuisines around the world. It's a simple and versatile dish that can be served as a side or as the base for a main course. However, cooking rice can be tricky, and many people struggle to get it just right. In this blog post, we'll show you how to make perfectly steamed rice every time with our easy and foolproof recipe.

## Ingredients

For this recipe, you'll need:

- 2 cups of white rice
- 2 1/2 cups of water
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 tbsp of butter (optional)

## Cooking Steps

1. Rinse the rice in a fine mesh strainer until the water runs clear. This will help remove excess starch and prevent the rice from becoming sticky.

2. In a medium pot, combine the rice, water, salt, and butter (if using). Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.

3. Cook the rice for 18-20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is tender and fluffy. Avoid lifting the lid or stirring the rice during this time as this can cause the steam to escape and affect the cooking process.

4. Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice rest for 5 minutes before fluffing it with a fork and serving.

## Variations

- Brown Rice: Substitute white rice for brown rice and increase the cooking time to 40-45 minutes.
- Coconut Rice: Replace half of the water with coconut milk and add a teaspoon of sugar for a sweet and fragrant rice.
- Lemon Rice: Add the zest of one lemon and a tablespoon of lemon juice for a fresh and tangy rice.
