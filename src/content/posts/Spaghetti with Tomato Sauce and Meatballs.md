## Ingredients

For the meatballs:

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the tomato sauce:

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

For the spaghetti:

- 1 pound spaghetti
- 2 tablespoons salt

## Instructions

1.  Preheat your oven to 400°F.

2.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, milk, egg, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix the ingredients together with your hands until well combined.

3.  Form the mixture into meatballs that are about 1 inch in diameter. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

4.  Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are cooked through.

5.  While the meatballs are cooking, start making the tomato sauce. In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the pan and sauté until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.

6.  Add the crushed tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the pan. Stir to combine.

7.  Bring the tomato sauce to a simmer and let it cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

8.  While the tomato sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the salt and the spaghetti to the pot and cook according to the package instructions, or until al dente.

9.  Drain the cooked spaghetti and return it to the pot.

10. Add the tomato sauce to the pot with the spaghetti and toss until the spaghetti is well coated with the sauce.

11. Serve the spaghetti with meatballs on top and enjoy!
