## Introduction

Italian Wedding Soup is a classic dish that is hearty, comforting, and delicious. Despite its name, the soup is not actually served at weddings in Italy. Instead, the name comes from the Italian phrase "minestra maritata," which means "married soup." This refers to the way the ingredients in the soup, such as the meatballs and vegetables, are "married" together to create a harmonious and flavorful dish.
