Lasagna is one of those classic Italian dishes that almost everyone loves. But if you're vegetarian or trying to eat less meat, it can be challenging to find a satisfying lasagna recipe. This vegetarian lasagna recipe is loaded with vegetables, herbs, and cheese. It's perfect for a comforting and satisfying family dinner.

## Ingredients

- 9 lasagna noodles
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 yellow squash, chopped
- 1 zucchini, chopped
- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 cups ricotta cheese
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Fresh basil leaves, for garnish

## Instructions

1.  Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2.  Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
3.  In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Add the bell pepper, squash, and zucchini, and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
4.  Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.
5.  In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup of the grated Parmesan cheese.
6.  In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture on top of the noodles, followed by a layer of the vegetable mixture. Repeat the layers until all of the ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of tomato sauce.
7.  Top the lasagna with the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.
8.  Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the lasagna is heated through.
9.  Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious vegetarian lasagna!
