These shortbread cookies are incredibly easy to make. Start by preheating your oven to 180°C (160°C fan)/350°F/gas mark 4. Then, in a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes. 

Next, add the flour and salt and mix until the dough comes together. You can use a wooden spoon or an electric mixer to do this. Once the dough is formed, roll it out on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1cm. You can use a rolling pin or your hands for this step.

Use a cookie cutter to cut out your desired shapes and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Make sure to leave some space between each cookie to allow for spreading.

Bake the cookies for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Keep an eye on them to make sure they don't overcook.

Once the cookies are done, cool them on the baking tray for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. This will help them set and prevent them from breaking.

## Variations

Shortbread cookies are a versatile treat that can be customized in many ways. Here are some variations you can try:

### Chocolate Chip Shortbread Cookies

Add 100g of chocolate chips to the dough before rolling it out. This will give your cookies a delicious chocolatey twist.

### Lemon Shortbread Cookies

Add the zest of one lemon to the dough for a zesty and refreshing flavor.

### Almond Shortbread Cookies

Add 50g of ground almonds to the dough for a nutty and crunchy texture.

### Vegan Shortbread Cookies

Replace the butter with vegan butter or coconut oil, and use a flax egg instead of a regular egg. This will make your shortbread cookies vegan-friendly.
