## FAQ

### Can I use regular lemons instead of Meyer lemons?

Yes, you can use regular lemons instead of Meyer lemons. However, Meyer lemons have a sweeter and less acidic flavor than regular lemons, so your cake may be slightly more tart.

### Can I use a different type of flour, such as whole wheat flour?

We recommend using all-purpose flour for this recipe to achieve the best texture and flavor. Using a different type of flour may result in a denser or drier cake.

### How do I know when the cake is finished baking?

You can test the cake for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is done. Alternatively, you can gently press on the top of the cake - if it springs back, it is done.

### Can I make this cake ahead of time?

Yes, you can make this cake ahead of time. It will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

### Can I freeze this cake?

Yes, you can freeze this cake. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in an airtight container or freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw it at room temperature before serving.

### Can I add other flavors to the cake, such as vanilla or almond extract?

Yes, you can add other flavors to the cake if you wish. Vanilla or almond extract would both be good choices, but be careful not to add too much as it may overpower the lemon flavor.

### Can I use a different type of pan, such as a bundt pan or mini loaf pans?

Yes, you can use a different type of pan for this cake. However, the baking time may vary depending on the size and shape of the pan. Check the cake for doneness using the toothpick or gentle press method.

### Can I use a sugar substitute, such as honey or maple syrup?

We recommend using granulated sugar for this recipe to achieve the best texture and flavor. Using a sugar substitute may result in a denser or drier cake, and may also affect the overall sweetness of the cake.

### Can I add other ingredients to the cake, such as berries or nuts?

Yes, you can add other ingredients to the cake if you wish. Blueberries or raspberries would be a nice addition, as would chopped nuts such as almonds or pecans. Fold them into the batter gently before baking.

### How should I serve the cake?

This cake is delicious on its own, but you can also serve it with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a lemon glaze. To make the glaze, mix together powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth, then drizzle it over the cooled cake.
