Chocolate chip cookies are a classic dessert that everyone loves. Whether you're making them for a party or just to enjoy at home, this recipe will show you how to make perfect chocolate chip cookies every time. They're crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and loaded with delicious chocolate chips.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 3/4 cup white granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1.  Preheat your oven to 375Â°F.

2.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3.  In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, white granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

4.  Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.

5.  Gradually add the flour mixture to the mixing bowl, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the dough.

6.  Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

7.  Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave about 2 inches of space between each cookie.

8.  Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown.

9.  Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes.

10. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.

This recipe makes about 24 cookies. If you want to make more, simply double or triple the recipe. You can also store any leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.

## Variations

There are many variations you can make to this classic recipe to switch things up. Here are a few ideas:

- Add chopped nuts: If you love nuts, try adding a cup of chopped walnuts, pecans or almonds to the dough along with the chocolate chips.

- Use different chocolate chips: While semisweet chocolate chips are the classic choice, you can try using milk chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips or even white chocolate chips for a different flavor.

- Use a different sweetener: If you don't have brown sugar, you can use 1 1/2 cups of white granulated sugar instead. You can also try using coconut sugar or honey for a healthier alternative.

- Add a pinch of cinnamon: For a warm, cozy flavor, add a pinch of cinnamon to the flour mixture.

- Make giant cookies: Use a larger cookie scoop or spoon to make fewer, larger cookies. Increase the baking time by a few minutes to make sure they're cooked through.

- Add mix-ins: If you're feeling creative, try adding other mix-ins to the dough, like shredded coconut, dried fruit or even crushed candy canes during the holidays.

With so many possibilities, there's no shortage of ways to customize this classic chocolate chip cookie recipe. So why not get creative and see what delicious variations you can come up with?

## Healthier versions

If you're looking for a healthier version of these cookies, there are also several substitutions you can make. Here are some tips for making healthier chocolate chip cookies:

- Use whole wheat flour: Replace half or all of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour for a higher fiber content.

- Use coconut oil: Replace the butter with coconut oil for a healthier fat option. Just make sure to use the same amount of solid coconut oil as you would butter.

- Reduce the sugar: Cut down on the sugar by using 1/2 cup white granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup of each.

- Use dark chocolate chips: Dark chocolate has a higher cocoa content and is generally lower in sugar than milk or semisweet chocolate.

- Add oats: For an extra dose of fiber, add 1 cup of old-fashioned rolled oats to the dough.

With these simple substitutions, you can make a slightly healthier version of classic chocolate chip cookies without sacrificing taste.

Whether you're making the classic recipe or trying out a new variation, chocolate chip cookies are a crowd-pleasing dessert that everyone will love. So why not whip up a batch today and enjoy the delicious, comforting taste of warm chocolate chip cookies fresh from the oven?
