## FAQ

### Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?

Yes, you can use frozen blueberries instead of fresh. Just be sure to thaw them completely and drain any excess liquid before adding them to the batter.

### How long do these muffins last?

These muffins can last up to 5 days if stored in an airtight container at room temperature. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.

### Can I substitute the all-purpose flour with almond flour?

It is not recommended to substitute all-purpose flour with almond flour as they have different properties. Almond flour is a denser flour and will change the texture and taste of the muffins.

### Do I need to use a stand mixer for this recipe?

No, you do not need to use a stand mixer for this recipe. You can mix the ingredients by hand using a whisk or a wooden spoon.

### Can I use a muffin tin with larger or smaller cups?

Yes, you can use a muffin tin with larger or smaller cups, but the baking time may need to be adjusted accordingly. Keep an eye on the muffins and remove them from the oven when they are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

### Can I add other fruits to the batter?

Yes, you can add other fruits to the batter such as raspberries or strawberries. Just be sure to chop them into small pieces so they mix well into the batter.

### Is it necessary to use buttermilk?

Yes, it is necessary to use buttermilk in this recipe as it helps to activate the baking powder and baking soda, giving the muffins their fluffy texture.

### Can I use vegetable oil instead of butter?

Yes, you can use vegetable oil instead of butter, but it may change the taste and texture of the muffins. Butter adds a rich flavor and moisture to the muffins that may be lost with vegetable oil.

### Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to the batter?

Yes, you can add nuts or chocolate chips to the batter for some extra flavor and texture. Just be sure to fold them in gently so they don't sink to the bottom.

### Can I use a different type of sugar?

Yes, you can use a different type of sugar such as brown sugar or coconut sugar, but it may change the taste and texture of the muffins. White granulated sugar is recommended for the best results.
