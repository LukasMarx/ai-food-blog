The main ingredients for Tzatziki are Greek yogurt, cucumber, garlic, lemon juice, and dill or mint.

### Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt?

No, it's important to use Greek yogurt for Tzatziki because it has a thicker consistency and lower water content, which is essential for the texture of the dip.

### Do I need to peel the cucumber?

Yes, you need to peel and seed the cucumber before grating it for the Tzatziki. The seeds can make the dip watery and the skin can be tough.

### What can I serve with Tzatziki?

Tzatziki is commonly served as a dip with pita bread or raw vegetables. It can also be used as a sauce for grilled meats or as a condiment for sandwiches.

### Can I use dried herbs instead of fresh herbs?

Fresh herbs are recommended for Tzatziki because they have a stronger flavor and aroma. If you don't have fresh herbs, you can use dried herbs, but the flavor won't be as pronounced.

### Can I add other ingredients to Tzatziki?

You can customize Tzatziki by adding other ingredients such as chopped olives, roasted red peppers, or sun-dried tomatoes. However, keep in mind that these additions may alter the traditional flavor of the dip.

### Can I use a food processor instead of grating the cucumber by hand?

It's best to grate the cucumber by hand for Tzatziki because it releases less water than when processed in a food processor. This helps to maintain the texture of the dip.

### Can I make Tzatziki spicy?

Yes, you can add chili flakes or hot sauce to Tzatziki to make it spicy. Adjust the amount of heat to your liking.
