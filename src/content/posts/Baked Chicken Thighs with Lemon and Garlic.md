## Why You Should Make Baked Chicken Thighs with Lemon and Garlic

Chicken thighs are a great protein option for a family meal or meal prep because they are inexpensive, flavorful, and easy to prepare. However, they can often be dry and lack flavor if not prepared properly. This recipe solves that problem by marinating the chicken thighs in a simple mixture of lemon, garlic, and herbs, resulting in juicy and flavorful chicken every time.

Another great thing about this recipe is that it requires minimal prep work, making it a great option for busy weeknights. Simply mix together the marinade, pour it over the chicken, and bake in the oven. It's that easy! Plus, you likely already have all of the ingredients in your pantry, making this recipe a convenient option when you're short on time or need to use up ingredients.

## Tips for Making Baked Chicken Thighs with Lemon and Garlic

To make sure your baked chicken thighs come out perfectly every time, here are a few tips to keep in mind:

- Use bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs for the best flavor and juiciness. The skin helps keep the chicken moist while it bakes, and it gets nice and crispy in the oven.

- Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel before adding the marinade. This helps the marinade stick to the chicken better and also helps the skin get crispy in the oven.

- Make sure the chicken thighs are evenly coated with the marinade before baking. This will ensure that every bite is flavorful and juicy.

- Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken. The chicken is done when it reaches 165°F (74°C).

- Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, resulting in tender and juicy meat.

## Conclusion

This baked chicken thighs with lemon and garlic recipe is a great way to switch up your weekly chicken routine. It's easy to make, bursting with flavor, and perfect for a family dinner or meal prep. With just a few simple ingredients and some basic prep work, you can have juicy and flavorful chicken thighs on the table in no time. Give this recipe a try and see for yourself just how delicious it can be!
