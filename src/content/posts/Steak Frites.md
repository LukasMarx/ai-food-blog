## FAQ

### What type of steak is best for Steak Frites?

Any type of steak can be used for Steak Frites, but we recommend using a cut with good marbling such as ribeye or sirloin for maximum flavor.

### How do I get my fries crispy?

To get crispy fries, soak them in cold water for at least 30 minutes before cooking to remove excess starch. Then, pat them dry and fry them twice - once on low heat to cook them through, and once on high heat to crisp them up.

### Can I use a different type of oil to fry the fries?

Yes, you can use a different type of oil such as peanut oil or canola oil. However, be aware that this may affect the flavor of the fries.

### Do I need to let the steak rest before serving?

### Can I make the fries ahead of time?

Yes, you can make the fries ahead of time and reheat them in the oven or a fryer before serving. However, they may not be as crispy as freshly cooked fries.

### How should I serve the steak and fries?

Traditionally, Steak Frites is served with the fries on the side and the steak sliced and arranged on a plate. You can also add a side salad or other vegetables for a complete meal.

### Can I use a different type of sauce for the steak?
