## FAQ

### Can I use regular coffee instead of espresso powder?

We recommend using espresso powder to get the strong coffee flavor that complements the chocolate chips in this recipe. However, if you don't have any espresso powder, you can use regular coffee, but it will be milder in flavor.

### Can I use milk chocolate chips instead of dark chocolate chips?

Yes, you can use milk chocolate chips instead of dark chocolate chips if you prefer a sweeter cookie. However, the dark chocolate chips provide a nice contrast to the sweetness of the cookie, so we recommend using them if possible.

### Can I use instant espresso instead of espresso powder?

Yes, you can use instant espresso instead of espresso powder. However, you will need to dissolve the instant espresso in a small amount of water before adding it to the dough.

### Can I make the dough ahead of time and refrigerate it?

Yes, you can make the dough ahead of time and refrigerate it for up to 3 days. Make sure to wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.

Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. The cookies will be soft when they come out of the oven, but they will firm up as they cool.
