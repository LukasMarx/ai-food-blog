Waffles are a classic breakfast item that everyone loves. But if you want to take your waffles to the next level, try making them with buttermilk. Buttermilk adds a tangy flavor and helps make the waffles fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. In this recipe, we'll show you how to make the perfect buttermilk waffles that are sure to become a family favorite.

## Ingredients

For 4 servings, you will need:

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract.

3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.

4. Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions. Grease the waffle iron with cooking spray or melted butter.

5. Scoop the batter onto the waffle iron, spreading it out with a spatula if necessary. Cook the waffles until golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes depending on your waffle iron.

6. Serve the waffles immediately with your favorite toppings, such as butter, syrup, fresh berries, and whipped cream.

## Variations

- **Chocolate Chip Waffles:** Add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter before cooking.
- **Blueberry Waffles:** Add 1 cup of fresh or frozen blueberries to the batter before cooking.
- **Banana Nut Waffles:** Add 1 ripe banana, mashed, and 1/2 cup of chopped nuts (such as pecans or walnuts) to the batter before cooking.
- **Vegetarian Waffles:** This recipe is already vegetarian, but you can make it vegan by using non-dairy milk and vegan butter instead of buttermilk and regular butter.

## Tips for Perfect Waffles

- Do not overmix the batter. A few lumps are okay; overmixing will make the waffles tough.
- Preheat your waffle iron thoroughly before cooking to ensure even cooking.
- Grease the waffle iron with cooking spray or melted butter to prevent sticking.
- Serve the waffles immediately after cooking for the best texture and flavor.
- Freeze any leftover waffles in a resealable plastic bag. To reheat, pop them in the toaster or toaster oven.
