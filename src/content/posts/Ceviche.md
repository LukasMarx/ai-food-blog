Ceviche is a refreshing and flavorful seafood dish that originated in Peru. It's the perfect dish for summer, as it's light, healthy, and packed with flavor. Ceviche is traditionally made with raw fish that's marinated in lime juice and seasoned with onions, peppers, and cilantro. The acid from the lime juice "cooks" the fish, giving it a slightly firm texture and a tangy flavor.

## Ingredients

Here's what you'll need to make ceviche for four people:

- 500g fresh white fish fillets, cut into small pieces
- 1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1-2 jalapeño peppers, seeded and chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 avocado, diced
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. In a large glass bowl, combine the fish and lime juice. Make sure the fish is fully submerged in the juice. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until the fish is opaque and firm.

2. Remove the fish from the lime juice and discard the juice. Add the sliced red onion, chopped jalapeño peppers, chopped red bell pepper, and chopped cilantro to the fish. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. Gently mix all the ingredients together until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until ready to serve.

4. When ready to serve, add the diced avocado to the ceviche and gently mix. Serve chilled and enjoy!

## Variations

- Vegetarian ceviche: You can make a vegetarian version of ceviche by using chopped mushrooms, hearts of palm, or tofu instead of fish. Marinate the vegetables in lime juice and seasonings just like you would with fish.
- Shrimp ceviche: Substitute shrimp for the fish in this recipe for a slightly different flavor. Shrimp cooks faster than fish, so you'll only need to marinate it for 10-15 minutes.
- Coconut ceviche: Add some coconut milk to the marinade for a creamier and slightly sweet version of ceviche.

## Conclusion

Ceviche is a healthy and delicious seafood dish that's perfect for summer. It's easy to make and can be customized to suit your taste preferences. Try making this recipe for your next dinner party or potluck, and watch as your guests rave about it!
