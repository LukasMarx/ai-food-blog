## FAQ

### What makes Lavender Shortbread Cookies special?

Lavender gives these cookies a unique aroma and flavor, adding a floral note to the classic buttery shortbread.

### Can I use dried lavender instead of fresh lavender?

Yes, you can use dried lavender instead of fresh lavender. Use half the amount of dried lavender as fresh, as dried lavender is more concentrated.

### Can I substitute butter with margarine?

We recommend using butter for this recipe as it provides the best flavor and texture. Margarine can be used, but the cookies will not have the same buttery taste.

### Can I freeze the cookie dough?

Yes, you can freeze the cookie dough. Shape the dough into a log, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw the dough in the refrigerator before slicing and baking.

### Can I use a cookie cutter instead of slicing the dough?

### How long will these cookies stay fresh?

These cookies will stay fresh for up to a week if stored in an airtight container at room temperature.

### Can I add other flavors to the cookies?

Yes, you can add other flavors to the cookies. Vanilla extract, lemon zest, or orange zest are all great options to add to the dough.

### Can I use a food processor to mix the dough?

Yes, you can use a food processor to mix the dough. Pulse the flour, sugar, and lavender until combined, then add the butter and pulse until the dough comes together.

### My cookies turned out too crumbly, what did I do wrong?

If your cookies turned out too crumbly, it's possible that you didn't mix the dough enough or that you overworked the dough. Try mixing the dough until it just comes together, and avoid overhandling the dough.

### Can I use gluten-free flour for this recipe?

Yes, you can use gluten-free flour for this recipe. Use a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend to replace the regular flour in the recipe.
