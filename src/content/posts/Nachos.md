## FAQ

### What kind of cheese should I use for nachos?

You can use any type of cheese that melts well, such as cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend of the two.

### Can I make nachos in advance?

While it is possible to assemble the nachos in advance, they are best when served immediately after being baked. If you need to prepare them in advance, keep the toppings separate from the chips and assemble just before baking.

### Can I use corn tortilla chips instead of flour tortilla chips?

Yes, you can use corn tortilla chips instead of flour tortilla chips. However, keep in mind that corn tortilla chips may break more easily and may not hold up as well under the weight of the toppings.

### Can I make nachos without meat?

Yes, you can make vegetarian nachos by omitting the meat or using a meat substitute such as tofu, tempeh, or crumbled veggie burgers.

### How do I keep the nachos from getting soggy?

To prevent the nachos from getting soggy, be sure to layer the ingredients evenly and use toppings that are not too wet. Avoid adding too much salsa or other liquidy toppings.

### Can I make nachos in the microwave?

While it is possible to make nachos in the microwave, they will not be as crispy as when baked in the oven. If using the microwave, be sure to use a microwave-safe dish and microwave in short intervals to prevent the cheese from burning.

### Can I add additional toppings to the nachos?

Yes, you can add additional toppings to the nachos, such as diced tomatoes, sliced jalapenos, or black beans. Just be sure not to overload the nachos with too many toppings, as this can make them difficult to eat.

### Can I use pre-shredded cheese for nachos?

Yes, you can use pre-shredded cheese for nachos. However, freshly grated cheese will melt more smoothly and evenly.

### Can I make nachos without an oven?

Yes, you can make nachos without an oven by using a toaster oven or a grill. Simply assemble the nachos on a heat-safe dish and cook until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

### Can I make nachos with leftover chili?

Yes, you can make nachos with leftover chili. Simply spoon the chili over the chips and top with cheese and other toppings before baking.
