## BBQ Brisket Sandwiches FAQ

### What type of brisket should I use for BBQ Brisket Sandwiches?

We recommend using a whole packer brisket for this recipe. This type of brisket contains both the point and the flat, and will yield the best results for tender and juicy meat.

### How long should I smoke the brisket for?

To achieve optimal tenderness and flavor, we suggest smoking the brisket for 10-12 hours at a temperature of 225-250°F. You may need to adjust cooking time based on the size of your brisket.

### Can I use a gas grill instead of a smoker?

While using a smoker is optimal for achieving the traditional smoky flavor of BBQ brisket, you can still achieve great results with a gas grill. Simply set one side of the grill to low heat and place the brisket on the other side, using wood chips to add a smoky flavor.

### Can I make the BBQ sauce ahead of time?

Absolutely! In fact, making the BBQ sauce ahead of time can help the flavors meld together for a richer taste. Store the sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.

### How do I know when the brisket is ready?

You can test the doneness of your brisket using a meat thermometer. The internal temperature should reach 195-205°F for optimal tenderness. Another indicator is the "probe test," where a probe or toothpick is inserted into the meat and should slide in and out easily when the brisket is done.

### Can I freeze leftover brisket?

Yes, you can freeze leftover brisket for up to 3 months. We recommend wrapping it tightly in foil or plastic wrap and placing it in an airtight container or freezer bag.

### What type of bread should I use for the sandwiches?

We recommend using a sturdy bread like a brioche bun, Kaiser roll, or ciabatta bread. The bread should be able to hold up to the juicy brisket and BBQ sauce without falling apart.

### Can I add other toppings to the sandwiches?

Absolutely! Some popular toppings for BBQ brisket sandwiches include coleslaw, pickles, onions, and jalapeños. Get creative and make the sandwich your own!

### Can I make the brisket in advance?

Yes, you can make the brisket in advance and reheat it when ready to serve. Wrap the brisket tightly in foil and place it in the fridge for up to 3 days. When ready to serve, reheat the brisket in a 300°F oven for 30-45 minutes or until heated through.

### What sides go well with BBQ Brisket Sandwiches?

Classic BBQ sides like mac and cheese, baked beans, and potato salad all pair well with BBQ brisket sandwiches. Corn on the cob, grilled veggies, and a side salad are also great options.
