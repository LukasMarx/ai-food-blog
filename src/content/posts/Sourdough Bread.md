## Introduction

Sourdough bread is a type of bread that is made without commercial yeast. Instead, it is made using a sourdough starter, which is a mixture of flour and water that has been fermented with wild yeasts and bacteria. This gives the bread a unique tangy flavor and a chewy texture. Sourdough bread is perfect for breakfast or as a snack, and it is surprisingly easy to make at home. In this post, we will show you how to make delicious sourdough bread using simple ingredients and easy-to-follow steps.

## Ingredients

Here's what you'll need to make sourdough bread for 4 portions:

- 500g bread flour
- 10g salt
- 50g active sourdough starter
- 375g water

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, salt, sourdough starter, and water in a large mixing bowl. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated and a shaggy dough forms. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

2. Perform a series of stretch-and-folds, pulling the dough up and over itself from all sides of the bowl. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

3. Repeat the stretch-and-fold process three more times, letting the dough rest for 30 minutes between each fold.

4. After the final fold, let the dough sit at room temperature for 6-8 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

5. Gently transfer the dough to a floured work surface and shape it into a boule or batard, depending on the shape of your baking vessel. Place the dough into a floured proofing basket or bowl, seam-side up, and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Let proof for 2-3 hours, or until the dough has risen by about 50%.

6. Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) with a Dutch oven or other oven-safe, lidded vessel inside. Carefully transfer the dough to the preheated vessel, seam-side down, and score the top with a sharp knife or razor blade.

7. Bake the bread, covered, for 20-25 minutes. Remove the lid and continue baking for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature of the bread reaches 200-210°F (93-99°C).

8. Remove the bread from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing and serving.

## Variations

- Whole wheat sourdough bread: Replace half of the bread flour with whole wheat flour for a heartier loaf.
- Honey oat sourdough bread: Add 1/4 cup honey and 1/2 cup rolled oats to the dough for a touch of sweetness and texture.
- Garlic and herb sourdough bread: Add 1-2 tablespoons minced garlic and 1 tablespoon dried herbs (such as rosemary, thyme, or oregano) to the dough for a savory twist.
- Vegan sourdough bread: Replace the water with a non-dairy milk and use a vegan butter or oil for greasing the baking vessel.
