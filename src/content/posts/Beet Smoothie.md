## Introduction

Smoothies are a great way to start your day, and this Beet Smoothie is no exception! Not only is it delicious and refreshing, but it's also packed with nutrients. Beets are a great source of vitamin C, fiber, and essential minerals like potassium and manganese. Spinach is another nutrient powerhouse, providing vitamin K, vitamin A, and iron. The banana adds natural sweetness and creaminess, while the almond milk and Greek yogurt provide protein and healthy fats. 

## Ingredients

Here's what you'll need to make this Beet Smoothie for 4 servings:

- 2 medium beets, peeled and chopped
- 2 cups spinach
- 1 banana
- 1 cup almond milk
- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup ice

## Instructions

1. Add the chopped beets, spinach, banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, honey, vanilla extract, and ice to a blender.

## Variations

- Vegan: To make this smoothie vegan, simply swap the Greek yogurt for a non-dairy yogurt or omit it altogether.

- More protein: To add more protein to your smoothie, you can add a scoop of your favorite protein powder or a tablespoon of chia seeds.

## Tips

- Use fresh beets for the best flavor and nutrition.
- If you don't have fresh beets, you can use canned beets instead. Just be sure to drain and rinse them before adding them to the blender.
- You can use either fresh or frozen banana for this recipe.
- If you're using a high-speed blender, you may not need to chop the beets before adding them to the blender.
