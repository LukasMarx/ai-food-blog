## FAQ

### Can I use a stovetop grill pan instead of an outdoor grill?

Yes, you can use a stovetop grill pan instead of an outdoor grill. Just make sure to heat the pan over medium-high heat before adding the eggplant slices.

### How thin should I slice the eggplant?

We recommend slicing the eggplant into 1/2 inch rounds. This thickness will allow the eggplant to cook evenly and absorb the flavors of the balsamic glaze.

### How long should I marinate the eggplant in the balsamic glaze?

We recommend marinating the eggplant for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to fully penetrate the eggplant. However, you can marinate the eggplant for up to 24 hours for a stronger flavor.

### Can I make the balsamic glaze ahead of time?

Yes, you can make the balsamic glaze ahead of time and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Simply reheat the glaze before using it on the grilled eggplant.

### Can I add other vegetables to the grill with the eggplant?

Yes, you can add other vegetables to the grill with the eggplant. Zucchini, bell peppers, and onions are all great options that pair well with the balsamic glaze.

### Can I use a different type of vinegar for the glaze?

While balsamic vinegar is the recommended vinegar for this recipe, you can use a different type of vinegar if you prefer. Red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar would both work well.

### Can I use a grill basket for the eggplant slices?

Yes, you can use a grill basket for the eggplant slices if you prefer. This will help prevent the eggplant from falling through the grill grates.

### How do I know when the eggplant is fully cooked?

The eggplant should be tender and lightly charred when fully cooked. You can test the eggplant for doneness by piercing it with a fork. If the fork slides easily through the flesh, the eggplant is done.

### Can I use dried herbs instead of fresh herbs?

While fresh herbs are recommended for this recipe, you can use dried herbs if you don't have fresh herbs on hand. Just keep in mind that the flavor may be slightly different.

### Can I serve the grilled eggplant cold?

Yes, you can serve the grilled eggplant cold as a salad or a side dish. Simply let the eggplant cool to room temperature before serving, or refrigerate it for a few hours before serving.
