## FAQ

### How long should I marinate the chicken for?

We recommend marinating the chicken for at least 2 hours, but no longer than 24 hours. This will give the chicken enough time to absorb the flavors of the marinade.

### Can I use Dijon mustard instead of honey mustard?

Yes, you can use Dijon mustard instead of honey mustard if you prefer. However, the dish will have a slightly different flavor.

### Can I grill the chicken on a stovetop grill pan instead of an outdoor grill?

### Do I need to baste the chicken while it's grilling?

No, you don't need to baste the chicken while it's grilling. The marinade will already be on the chicken and will create a flavorful glaze as it cooks.

### How do I know when the chicken is fully cooked?

The best way to tell if chicken is fully cooked is to use a meat thermometer. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C) to ensure that it's safe to eat.

### Can I make the marinade ahead of time?
