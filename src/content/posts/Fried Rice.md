## FAQ

### What kind of rice should I use for fried rice?

Long grain white rice or Jasmine rice are the best options for fried rice. It is important that the rice is cooked and cooled beforehand, preferably left in the fridge overnight.

### Can I use brown rice instead of white rice?

Brown rice can be used instead of white rice, but it will have a different texture and flavor. Brown rice takes longer to cook than white rice, so it is important to plan accordingly.

### Can I add any vegetables to the fried rice?

Yes, you can add any vegetables you like to the fried rice. Some popular options include peas, carrots, onion, and bell pepper. It is important to chop the vegetables into small pieces so that they cook evenly.

Either fresh or frozen vegetables can be used for fried rice, but it is important to thaw frozen vegetables before using them. Fresh vegetables will have a crisper texture than frozen vegetables.

### Can I use pre-cooked rice for fried rice?

Yes, pre-cooked rice can be used for fried rice, but freshly cooked and cooled rice will have a better texture. If using pre-cooked rice, it is important to break up any clumps before adding it to the pan.

### What kind of oil should I use for frying rice?

Any neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil or canola oil, can be used for frying rice. It is important to use high heat when frying rice so that it becomes crispy and doesn't stick to the pan.

### Can I add meat to the fried rice?

Yes, you can add any type of meat you like to the fried rice. Popular options include chicken, shrimp, and pork. It is important to cook the meat before adding it to the pan.

### Should I add soy sauce to the fried rice?
