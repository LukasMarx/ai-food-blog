Pizza is one of the most popular and versatile dishes in the world, and making it at home is easier than you might think. With this simple recipe, you can create a delicious pizza with your favorite toppings in the comfort of your own kitchen.

## Ingredients

For the dough:

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup warm water

For the sauce:

- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the toppings:

- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Your choice of additional toppings, such as pepperoni, sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms, or olives

## Instructions

1.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the olive oil and warm water, and stir until a shaggy dough forms.
2.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
3.  While the dough is rising, make the sauce. In a medium saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer over low heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened.
4.  Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.
5.  Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a floured surface and punch it down. Roll or stretch the dough into a circle or rectangle, depending on the shape of your baking sheet or pizza stone. Transfer the dough to your baking sheet or pizza stone.
6.  Spread the sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edge. Add your desired toppings, starting with the cheese and working your way up to the other toppings.
7.  Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
8.  Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!

## Notes

- If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a baking sheet instead. Just be sure to preheat it in the oven before adding the pizza dough.
- To make the pizza dough ahead of time, you can let it rise in the refrigerator overnight. Just be sure to bring it to room temperature before rolling it out.
- This recipe makes one large pizza, but you can easily double the recipe to make two pizzas if you're feeding a crowd.
