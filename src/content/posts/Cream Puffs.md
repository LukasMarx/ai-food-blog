## FAQ

### What are cream puffs?

Cream puffs are small pastries made from choux pastry dough. They are typically filled with whipped cream, pastry cream, or ice cream and can be topped with powdered sugar or chocolate.

### Can I make cream puffs ahead of time?

Yes, you can make cream puffs ahead of time. Once the puffs are baked and cooled, store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days. You can also freeze the unfilled puffs for up to one month.

### How do I know when the choux pastry is ready?

The choux pastry is ready when it is smooth and glossy and falls off the spoon in a V-shape. You should also be able to draw a line through the batter with your finger and have it stay in place.

### Can I substitute the whipped cream for another filling?

Yes, you can substitute the whipped cream for another filling such as pastry cream, ganache, or even ice cream. Just make sure the filling is thick enough to hold its shape inside the puffs.

### How do I fill the cream puffs?

To fill the cream puffs, use a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Insert the tip into the bottom of the puff and gently squeeze the filling inside until it starts to come out of the hole.

### Can I make the puffs smaller or larger?

Yes, you can make the puffs smaller or larger depending on your preference. Just adjust the size of the pastry bag tip accordingly.

### How do I store leftover cream puffs?

Leftover cream puffs should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They will keep for up to two days.

### Can I make the choux pastry in advance?

You can make the choux pastry in advance, but it is best to bake the puffs right after making the dough. If you need to bake them later, you can refrigerate the dough for up to two days or freeze it for up to one month.

### How long do cream puffs last?

Cream puffs are best eaten the same day they are filled, but they will keep in the refrigerator for up to two days. However, the longer they sit, the softer and less crispy they will become.

### Can I make gluten-free cream puffs?

Yes, you can make gluten-free cream puffs by using a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour. Just make sure the blend contains xanthan gum or another binding agent to help the puffs hold their shape.
