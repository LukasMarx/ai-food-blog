## FAQ

### Can I replace the honey with another sweetener?

While honey is an essential ingredient in this recipe, you can substitute it with an equal amount of maple syrup or molasses for a different flavor.

### Can I use regular flour instead of cake flour?

Cake flour is recommended in this recipe for its lower protein content, which results in a softer and more tender cake. However, if you don't have cake flour, you can make your own by measuring out 1 cup of all-purpose flour and removing 2 tablespoons of it. Replace the removed flour with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and sift the mixture together.

### Can I make this cake ahead of time?

Yes, this cake can be made a day or two in advance. Simply wrap it in plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container at room temperature.

Absolutely! Chopped nuts, such as walnuts or pecans, and dried fruit, such as raisins or cranberries, can be added to the batter for extra texture and flavor.

### Can I make this cake without eggs?

This recipe calls for two eggs, which can be substituted with 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce or mashed banana for a vegan option.

### How do I know when the cake is done baking?

To test if the cake is done, insert a toothpick or cake tester into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready. If there are still moist crumbs on the tester, bake for a few more minutes and test again.

### Can I add frosting or glaze to the cake?

Yes, you can add a simple glaze made with powdered sugar and milk or a cream cheese frosting to the cake for extra sweetness.

### How should I store leftover cake?

Wrap any leftover cake in plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days.
