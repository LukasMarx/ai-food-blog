Whether you are hosting a party, looking for a quick snack, or want to enjoy a delicious appetizer, pakoras are the way to go. In this blog post, we will show you how to make pakoras from scratch using simple ingredients that you may already have in your pantry.

## Ingredients

To make pakoras, you will need the following ingredients:

- 1 cup gram flour
- 1/4 cup rice flour
- 1/2 tsp cumin powder
- 1/2 tsp coriander powder
- 1/4 tsp turmeric powder

## Instructions

Follow these steps to make delicious pakoras:

1. In a mixing bowl, combine gram flour, rice flour, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.

2. Add water gradually to the dry ingredients and mix to form a smooth batter without any lumps. The batter should have a thick consistency.
