Cochinita Pibil is a traditional Mexican dish that originated in the Yucatán Peninsula. It is a flavorful and spicy pork dish that is perfect for a family dinner or a taco party with friends. The pork is marinated in a mixture of sour orange juice, vinegar, garlic, and spices, then slow-cooked in the oven until tender and juicy. The result is a dish that is bursting with flavor and aroma, and that will transport you to the heart of Mexico with every bite.

## Ingredients

Here are the ingredients you'll need to make Cochinita Pibil for 4 portions:

- 1 kg pork shoulder, cut into chunks
- 1/2 cup sour orange juice
- 1/4 cup white vinegar
- 4 garlic cloves
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp achiote paste
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 banana leaf (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Marinade

In a blender, mix the sour orange juice, white vinegar, garlic, salt, black pepper, cumin, oregano, achiote paste, cinnamon, and cloves until you have a smooth marinade.

### Step 2: Marinate the Pork

Place the pork chunks in a large bowl and pour the marinade over them. Mix well and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let it marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

### Step 3: Cook the Pork

Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F).

In a large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the marinated pork and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently, until browned on all sides.

If you're using a banana leaf, rinse it under cold water and pat it dry. Line the bottom and sides of the pot with the banana leaf, letting it hang over the edges.

Transfer the pork to the pot, along with the marinade. Cover the pot with the banana leaf, if using, and then with a tight-fitting lid.

### Step 5: Serve and Enjoy!

## Vegetarian/Vegan Variation

Unfortunately, Cochinita Pibil is a meat-based dish and there is no easy way to make a vegetarian or vegan version that captures the same flavors and textures. However, you can try to make a vegan version of the marinade and use it to marinate tofu, tempeh, or seitan. You can then bake the marinated protein until crispy and serve it with the same toppings as the original dish.

## Gluten-Free Variation

Cochinita Pibil is naturally gluten-free, as long as you use gluten-free spices and ingredients. Make sure to check the labels of the achiote paste and any other spice blends you use to ensure they are gluten-free. Serve with gluten-free corn tortillas or as a topping for a gluten-free salad.

## Conclusion

Cochinita Pibil is a delicious and flavorful Mexican dish that is easy to make and perfect for a family dinner or a taco party with friends. The combination of spices and sour orange juice gives the pork a unique and addictive flavor that will make you want to come back for more.
