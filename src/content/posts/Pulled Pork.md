## Variations

### Vegetarian/Vegan Pulled "Pork"

If you're following a vegetarian or vegan diet, you can still enjoy the flavors of pulled pork with this meat-free version. Simply replace the pork shoulder with a block of firm tofu or a can of jackfruit. Drain and press the tofu or jackfruit to remove excess moisture, then shred it with a fork. Follow the same cooking method as the pork, but reduce the cooking time to 4 hours.

### Smoky Pulled Pork

For a smokier flavor, add 1 tbsp of liquid smoke to the barbecue sauce before pouring it over the pork shoulder. You can also cook the pork shoulder on a smoker instead of in the oven.

### Spicy Pulled Pork

If you like your pulled pork with a kick, add 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to the spice mixture. You can also top your pulled pork with sliced jalapeños or hot sauce.

### Carolina-style Pulled Pork

Carolina-style pulled pork is traditionally served with a vinegar-based sauce instead of a tomato-based barbecue sauce. To make the sauce, combine 1 cup of apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup of water, 2 tbsp of brown sugar, 1 tbsp of hot sauce, 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp of salt, and 1 tsp of black pepper in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the sauce over the pulled pork before serving.
