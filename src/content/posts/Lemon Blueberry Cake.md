## FAQ

### Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh ones?

Yes, you can use frozen blueberries instead of fresh ones. However, make sure to thaw them first and pat them dry to avoid excess moisture in the cake.

### Can I substitute lemon juice for lemon extract?

Yes, you can substitute lemon juice for lemon extract. However, lemon juice is more acidic and may affect the texture of the cake. You may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe accordingly.

### Can I make this cake ahead of time?

Yes, you can make this cake ahead of time. Store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the fridge for up to 1 week.

### Can I use a different type of flour?

You can use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour, but the texture of the cake may be slightly different. Cake flour has less protein than all-purpose flour, which results in a more tender and delicate crumb.

### How can I prevent the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the cake?

Coat the blueberries in flour before adding them to the batter. This will help them stay suspended in the batter and prevent them from sinking.

### Can I use a different type of fruit?

Yes, you can use a different type of fruit. Raspberries or blackberries would be a great alternative to blueberries in this recipe.

### Can I use a bundt pan instead of a cake pan?

Yes, you can use a bundt pan instead of a cake pan. However, you may need to adjust the baking time as bundt pans are deeper and take longer to bake.

### Can I omit the lemon zest?

You can omit the lemon zest, but it adds a lot of flavor to the cake. If you don't have a zester, you can use a vegetable peeler to remove the yellow part of the lemon peel and finely chop it.

### Can I use margarine instead of butter?

You can use margarine instead of butter, but the flavor and texture of the cake may be slightly different. We recommend using unsalted butter for best results.

### Can I freeze this cake?

Yes, you can freeze this cake. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months.
