BBQ chicken wings are the perfect addition to any get-together or summer barbecue. They are easy to make, delicious, and always a crowd-pleaser. In this recipe, we are going to show you how to make crispy BBQ chicken wings with a sticky glaze in just a few simple steps. 

## Ingredients (4 servings)
- 1 kg chicken wings
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 cup barbecue sauce

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C.
2. Season the chicken wings with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
3. Place the chicken wings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
4. Bake the chicken wings for 20 minutes, then flip them over and bake for another 10 minutes.
5. Remove the chicken wings from the oven and brush them with barbecue sauce.
6. Return the chicken wings to the oven and bake for another 5-10 minutes, until the sauce is caramelized and the chicken wings are crispy.
7. Serve the chicken wings hot with extra barbecue sauce on the side.

First, preheat your oven to 200°C. While the oven is heating up, season the chicken wings with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Make sure to coat the chicken wings evenly with the seasoning. Next, place the chicken wings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. This will prevent the chicken wings from sticking to the baking sheet and make cleanup easier.

Bake the chicken wings in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, flip the chicken wings over and bake for another 10 minutes. This will ensure that both sides of the chicken wings are crispy and golden brown.

Remove the chicken wings from the oven and brush them with barbecue sauce. You can use your favorite barbecue sauce or make your own. Make sure to coat the chicken wings evenly with the sauce.

Return the chicken wings to the oven and bake for another 5-10 minutes, until the sauce is caramelized and the chicken wings are crispy. Keep an eye on the chicken wings during this step to make sure they don't burn.

Once the chicken wings are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving. Serve the chicken wings hot with extra barbecue sauce on the side.

## Variations
- Spicy BBQ chicken wings: Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes to the seasoning mix for some extra heat.
- Honey BBQ chicken wings: Replace the barbecue sauce with honey barbecue sauce for a sweeter flavor.
- Teriyaki chicken wings: Replace the barbecue sauce with teriyaki sauce and sprinkle sesame seeds on top before serving.
- Vegetarian BBQ wings: Replace the chicken wings with cauliflower florets for a vegetarian option.

Enjoy your delicious BBQ chicken wings with family and friends at your next game night or summer barbecue!
