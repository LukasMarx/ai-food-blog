## Ingredients

For the dough:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/4 cup plain yogurt
- 1/4 cup warm water

For the filling:
- 1 lb ground lamb or beef
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar. Add the yogurt and warm water and mix until a dough forms.

2. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-15 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 30-45 minutes.
