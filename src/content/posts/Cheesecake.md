### How do I prevent cracks from forming on top of my cheesecake?

To prevent cracks from forming on top of your cheesecake, make sure to not overmix the ingredients and to not overbake the cheesecake. You can also place a pan of water in the oven while the cheesecake is baking to create steam and prevent the cheesecake from drying out.

### How long should I let my cheesecake cool before refrigerating it?

Let your cheesecake cool at room temperature for about an hour before refrigerating it. This will prevent condensation from forming on top of the cheesecake and creating a soggy texture.

### Can I freeze my cheesecake?

### Can I make a cheesecake without a springform pan?
