## Introduction

New England Lobster Rolls are a classic summer dish that originated in the Northeastern United States. They are quick and easy to make, and they bring the taste of the ocean to your plate. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the steps to make the perfect New England Lobster Roll.

## Ingredients

- 4 hot dog buns
- 1 lb cooked lobster meat
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup celery, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, mix the cooked lobster meat, mayonnaise, celery, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Use a fork to break up any large chunks of lobster meat and mix until well combined.

3. Spoon the lobster mixture into each hot dog bun. Make sure to fill each bun evenly with the lobster mixture.

## Variations

- **Connecticut-style Lobster Roll:** Skip the mayonnaise and mix the lobster meat with melted butter instead. Toast the hot dog bun in butter until golden brown.
- **Maine-style Lobster Roll:** Replace the hot dog bun with a split-top New England-style hot dog bun. Toast the bun on both sides and brush with melted butter. Fill the bun with the lobster mixture and serve with a side of potato chips.
- **Vegan Lobster Roll:** Replace the lobster meat with hearts of palm, which have a similar texture to lobster meat. Mix the hearts of palm with vegan mayo, celery, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Serve in a hot dog bun with a side of sweet potato fries.
- **Gluten-free Lobster Roll:** Replace the hot dog bun with a gluten-free bun or lettuce leaves. Make sure to check that all ingredients are gluten-free, including the lobster meat and mayonnaise.
