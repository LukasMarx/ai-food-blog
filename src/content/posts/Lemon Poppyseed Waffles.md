## Why You Should Make Lemon Poppyseed Waffles

Who doesn't love a good waffle for brunch? These Lemon Poppyseed Waffles take your brunch game to the next level with their bright, citrusy flavor and crunchy poppy seeds. They're perfect for a lazy weekend morning or a special occasion brunch with friends and family. 

The lemon flavor in these waffles comes from both fresh lemon juice and lemon zest, giving them a bright, tangy flavor that pairs perfectly with the nutty crunch of the poppy seeds. Plus, they're made with simple, pantry-staple ingredients that you probably already have on hand.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar

- 1 tbsp lemon zest

## Instructions

3. In another bowl, beat the eggs until light and frothy. Add the milk, melted butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest, stirring to combine.
4. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. It’s okay if there are a few lumps in the batter.
