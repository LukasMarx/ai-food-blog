## FAQ

### What cut of pork should I use for BBQ Pork Sliders?

We recommend using pork shoulder or pork butt for the best results. These cuts are well-marbled and will become tender and juicy after cooking low and slow.

### How long should I cook the pork for?

The pork should be cooked on low heat for 8-10 hours in a slow cooker or for 4-5 hours in an oven at 325°F. The pork is done when it is tender enough to shred easily with a fork.

### Can I use a different type of barbecue sauce?

Yes, you can use any type of barbecue sauce that you prefer. Sweet, spicy, or smoky sauces all work well with pork.
