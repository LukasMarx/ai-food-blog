## Variations

### Vegetarian/Vegan Version

If you want to make a vegetarian/vegan version of this recipe, you can replace the pork shoulder with jackfruit. Jackfruit has a similar texture to pulled pork and absorbs flavor well, making it a great substitute. Follow the same recipe, but use canned or fresh jackfruit instead of pork shoulder.

### Coleslaw Topping

To add some extra crunch and freshness to your pulled pork sandwich, you can add a coleslaw topping. Simply mix shredded cabbage, carrots, and your favorite dressing (mayonnaise or vinegar-based) in a bowl. Place the coleslaw on top of the pulled pork before adding the top bun.

### Barbecue Sauce

If you want to add some extra flavor to your pulled pork sandwich, you can make your own barbecue sauce. Mix ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and your favorite spices in a small saucepan. Cook on low heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Drizzle the barbecue sauce on top of the pulled pork before adding the top bun.

### Cheese Topping

For a cheesy twist on your pulled pork sandwich, you can add your favorite cheese on top of the pork. Cheddar, Swiss, or pepper jack would all work well. Place the cheese on top of the pulled pork and broil in the oven for 2-3 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

With these variations, you can make your pulled pork sandwiches unique and tailored to your taste preferences. Enjoy!
