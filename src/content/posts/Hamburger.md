## FAQ

### How to shape the perfect burger patty?

To shape the perfect burger patty, use 80/20 ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat) and form the patties with a gentle touch, without overworking the meat. Make sure the patties are slightly larger than the burger buns, as they will shrink during cooking.

### How to cook the perfect burger patty?

To cook the perfect burger patty, heat a skillet or grill over high heat and add the patties. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, 4-5 minutes per side for medium, and 5-6 minutes per side for well-done. Avoid pressing down on the patties with a spatula, as this will release the juices and make the burger dry.

### How to add cheese to the burger?

To add cheese to the burger, place a slice of cheese on top of the patties during the last minute of cooking. Cover the skillet or grill with a lid to melt the cheese.

### What kind of cheese is best for a burger?

The best cheese for a burger is a cheese that melts well, such as American, cheddar, or Swiss cheese. You can also try blue cheese, feta, or pepper jack for a different flavor.

### How to toast the burger buns?

To toast the burger buns, slice them in half and place them cut-side down on the grill or skillet for 1-2 minutes, until they are golden brown and slightly crispy.

### How to assemble the burger?

To assemble the burger, place the bottom bun on a plate, add a lettuce leaf, a tomato slice, and a few pickle slices. Place the cooked patty on top of the vegetables, add your choice of sauce (ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.), and place the top bun on top of the sauce.

### Can I use a different type of meat for the patty?

Yes, you can use a different type of meat for the patty, such as ground turkey, chicken, or pork. However, keep in mind that the cooking time and temperature may differ.

### Can I make the patties ahead of time?

Yes, you can make the patties ahead of time and store them in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Make sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent oxidation.

### How to store leftover burgers?

To store leftover burgers, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat them in the oven or on the stovetop before serving.

### What are some toppings that go well with a burger?

Some toppings that go well with a burger are sautéed onions, mushrooms, bacon, avocado, jalapeños, or a fried egg. You can also try different sauces, such as BBQ sauce, chipotle mayo, or garlic aioli.
