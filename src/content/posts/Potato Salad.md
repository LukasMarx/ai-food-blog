It's easy to make, can be prepared in advance, and pairs well with a variety of other dishes. Plus, it's a great way to use up any leftover potatoes you might have in the pantry.

## Ingredients

For this recipe, you will need:

- 1 kg potatoes
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup chopped red onion
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped

## Instructions

1. Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly. Cut them into small cubes and place them in a pot of cold, salted water.
2. Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until they are fork-tender, about 10-15 minutes.
3. Drain the potatoes and let them cool completely.
4. In a large bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, chopped red onion, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, salt, and black pepper.

## Variations

- **Vegetarian Version:** Omit the hard-boiled eggs and add in some diced celery or cucumber for extra crunch.

- **Herbaceous Version:** Add in some chopped fresh herbs like parsley, dill, or chives for extra flavor.
- **Spicy Version:** Add in some chopped jalape√±os or hot sauce for a bit of heat.

## Tips and Tricks

- Be sure to use waxy potatoes like Yukon Gold or red potatoes for this recipe. They hold their shape better than starchy potatoes like Russets.
- Don't overcook the potatoes or they will turn mushy and fall apart in the salad.
- Let the salad chill in the fridge for at least an hour before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.
- If you're making this salad ahead of time, reserve a bit of the dressing and toss it with the salad just before serving to refresh the flavors.
