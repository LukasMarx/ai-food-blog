## FAQ

### What cut of beef should I use for Beef Fajitas?

The best cuts of beef for fajitas are skirt steak, flank steak, or sirloin steak. These cuts are tender and flavorful, and they cook quickly over high heat.

### How should I marinate the beef?

To marinate the beef, combine lime juice, olive oil, garlic, cumin, chili powder, and salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Add the beef and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.

### Can I use a different type of pepper instead of bell peppers?
