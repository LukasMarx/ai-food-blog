## FAQ

### How many apples do I need for an apple pie?

It depends on the size of your apples and the size of your pie dish, but generally you will need about 6-8 medium-sized apples.

### Should I peel the apples before making the pie?

Yes, you should peel the apples before making the pie. The skin can be tough and chewy, and it can also affect the texture of the filling.

### Can I use a pre-made pie crust?

Yes, you can use a pre-made pie crust if you don't want to make your own. Just make sure it's the right size for your pie dish.

### How do I prevent the crust from getting too brown?

You can cover the edges of the pie crust with foil to prevent them from browning too quickly. You can also brush the edges with an egg wash made from one beaten egg and a tablespoon of water before baking, which will give the crust a shiny finish and help it brown evenly.

### Can I make the pie ahead of time?

Yes, you can make the pie ahead of time and store it in the fridge for up to two days. Just make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or foil.

### Can I freeze the pie?

Yes, you can freeze the pie before or after baking. If you freeze it before baking, make sure to thaw it completely in the fridge before baking. If you freeze it after baking, let it cool completely before wrapping it tightly and freezing.

### How do I know when the pie is done baking?

The crust should be golden brown and the filling should be bubbly. You can also test the doneness of the apples by inserting a sharp knife into the center of the pie – it should slide in easily.

### How long should I let the pie cool before serving?

You should let the pie cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. This will help the filling set and make it easier to slice.

### Can I add other fruits to the filling?

Yes, you can add other fruits to the filling if you like. Some good options include pears, cranberries, or raisins.

### How should I store leftover pie?

You can store leftover pie in the fridge for up to three days. Just make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or foil.
