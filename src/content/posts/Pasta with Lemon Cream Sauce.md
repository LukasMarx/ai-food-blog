## FAQ

### Can I use any type of pasta for this recipe?

Yes, you can use any type of pasta you like. However, we recommend using a pasta with a shape that can hold the sauce, such as fusilli, penne, or farfalle.

### Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh lemon juice?

While you can use bottled lemon juice, we recommend using fresh lemon juice for the best flavor. Bottled lemon juice can have a slightly bitter taste and lacks the freshness of fresh lemon juice.

### Can I make the sauce ahead of time?

While you can make the sauce ahead of time, we recommend making it fresh as the lemon cream sauce can separate if it sits for too long. If you do make it ahead of time, reheat it over low heat and whisk it until it comes back together.

### Can I add vegetables to the pasta?

Yes, you can add vegetables to the pasta. We recommend adding vegetables such as asparagus, zucchini, or broccoli that pair well with lemon. Sauté the vegetables in olive oil until they are tender, and then add them to the pasta and sauce.

### Can I use a substitute for heavy cream?

Yes, you can use a substitute for heavy cream such as half-and-half or whole milk. However, the sauce will not be as rich and creamy.

### Can I use a different type of cheese?

Yes, you can use a different type of cheese such as parmesan or romano. However, we recommend using a cheese that has a tangy flavor that pairs well with lemon.

### Can I use a non-dairy milk substitute?

While you can use a non-dairy milk substitute, the sauce will not be as rich and creamy as it would be with heavy cream. We recommend using a non-dairy milk substitute that is high in fat, such as coconut milk.

### Can I use a different type of citrus fruit?

Yes, you can use a different type of citrus fruit such as lime or orange. However, the flavor of the sauce will be different than if you use lemon.

### Can I make this recipe gluten-free?

Yes, you can make this recipe gluten-free by using gluten-free pasta. Be sure to check the ingredients of any other products used in the recipe, such as chicken broth, to ensure they are also gluten-free.

### Can I make this recipe vegan?

While this recipe contains dairy products, you can make it vegan by substituting the heavy cream with a non-dairy milk substitute, and using vegan cheese.
