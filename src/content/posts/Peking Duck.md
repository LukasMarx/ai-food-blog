## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Duck

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Rinse the duck inside and out and pat dry with paper towels. Cut off excess fat and skin from the neck and tail.

### Step 2: Prepare the Glaze

In a small pot, combine maltose, honey, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Heat until everything is melted and well combined. Let the mixture cool down.

### Step 3: Glaze the Duck

Pour the mixture into the duck's body cavity, using a brush to coat the entire interior. Place the ginger slices and scallions inside the cavity. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and tuck the wings under the body.
