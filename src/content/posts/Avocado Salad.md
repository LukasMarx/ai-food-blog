## FAQ

### 1. How long can I keep the avocado salad?

### 2. Can I add other ingredients to the avocado salad?

Yes, you can add other ingredients to the avocado salad such as diced tomatoes, diced red onion, or crumbled feta cheese. Just make sure that the additional ingredients complement the flavors of the avocado.

### 3. Can I make the avocado salad ahead of time?

### 4. How do I select the right avocado for the salad?

Select an avocado that is slightly soft to the touch but not mushy. If it is too hard, it will not be ripe enough to use in the salad. If it is too soft, it may be overripe and not have the right texture.
