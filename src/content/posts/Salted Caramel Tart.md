## Recipe Variations

### Vegan Salted Caramel Tart

To make this recipe vegan, simply replace the butter with a vegan butter substitute and use coconut cream instead of heavy cream. The crust can be made vegan by using a non-dairy butter and a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of the egg yolk.

### Chocolate Salted Caramel Tart

For a decadent twist on this recipe, add some melted dark chocolate to the caramel filling before pouring it into the tart crust. Top with some additional sea salt flakes and grated chocolate for a show-stopping dessert.

### Mini Salted Caramel Tarts
