## FAQ

### What type of potatoes should I use to make French fries?

### Should I soak the potatoes before frying them?

Yes, you should soak the potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes before frying them. This will remove excess starch from the potatoes and make them crispier.

### How many times should I fry the potatoes?

You should fry the potatoes twice. The first fry should be at a lower temperature to cook the potatoes through, and the second fry should be at a higher temperature to make them crispy.

### What type of oil should I use to fry the potatoes?

You should use an oil with a high smoke point such as peanut oil or canola oil to fry the potatoes. These oils can withstand high temperatures without burning.
