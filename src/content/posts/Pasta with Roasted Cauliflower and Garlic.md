## FAQ

Yes, you can use frozen cauliflower instead of fresh cauliflower. However, the texture may be slightly different and you may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly.

### Can I use a different type of pasta?

Yes, you can use a different type of pasta. However, we recommend using a pasta with ridges or nooks and crannies to help the sauce stick to the pasta.

Yes, you can use less garlic if you prefer. However, the garlic adds a lot of flavor to the dish, so we recommend using at least a few cloves.

Yes, you can use a different type of cheese. However, we recommend using a cheese that melts well and has a strong flavor, such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano.

### Can I add other vegetables to the dish?

Yes, you can add other vegetables to the dish. However, be aware that some vegetables may require longer cooking times than cauliflower, so you may need to adjust the recipe accordingly.

### Can I make this dish ahead of time?

Yes, you can make this dish ahead of time. However, we recommend reheating it in the oven or on the stove to prevent the pasta from becoming mushy.

### Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil?

Yes, you can use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. However, be aware that olive oil has a stronger flavor than vegetable oil, so it may slightly alter the taste of the dish.
