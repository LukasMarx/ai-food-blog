- 200ml warm water

## Instructions

2. Mix well until the dough comes together. Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
3. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.
4. Punch down the dough and divide it into 4 equal pieces. Roll out each piece into a thin circle and add your favorite toppings.

## Variations

### Whole Wheat Pizza Dough

For a healthier alternative, you can swap out half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour. This will give your dough a slightly nuttier flavor and a heartier texture.

### Vegan Pizza Dough

To make this recipe vegan, simply omit the honey and replace the olive oil with vegetable oil or coconut oil. You can also add some herbs like oregano or basil to give the dough an extra kick of flavor.

### Gluten-Free Pizza Dough

If you're gluten intolerant, you can use a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour. Keep in mind that gluten-free dough is usually more delicate and may require a different baking time and temperature.

## Tips and Tricks

- Make sure your yeast is fresh and not expired, otherwise your dough won't rise properly.
- If you don't have a stand mixer, you can knead the dough by hand on a floured surface.
- Letting the dough rise in a warm place (around 25-30°C or 77-86°F) will speed up the process.
- Don't overload your pizza with toppings or the crust won't cook properly.
- For a crispier crust, bake your pizza on a preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet turned upside down.

That's it! With these simple steps, you can make delicious homemade pizza dough that's perfect for any occasion. Whether you like it thin and crispy or thick and chewy, this recipe is sure to please. So, grab your favorite toppings and get ready to enjoy a hot and fresh pizza straight from your own oven.

## FAQ

### Can I use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour for Pizza Dough?

Yes, you can use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but the texture of the dough will be slightly different. Bread flour contains more gluten, which gives the dough a chewier texture. If you use all-purpose flour, your dough will be softer and less chewy.

### How long should I knead the Pizza Dough?

You should knead the dough for at least 10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Kneading helps to activate the gluten in the flour, which gives the dough its structure.

### Can I make Pizza Dough in advance?

Yes, you can make Pizza Dough in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. This will allow the dough to develop more flavor. Just make sure to bring the dough to room temperature before using it.

### Can I freeze Pizza Dough?

Yes, you can freeze Pizza Dough for up to 3 months. To thaw the dough, transfer it to the refrigerator and let it thaw overnight. Then bring the dough to room temperature before using it.

### How thin should I roll out the Pizza Dough?

This depends on your personal preference. Some people like their pizza crust thin and crispy, while others prefer a thicker, softer crust. As a general rule, you should roll the dough out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.

### Do I need to let the Pizza Dough rise?

Yes, you need to let the Pizza Dough rise for at least an hour before using it. This allows the yeast to work its magic and gives the dough its characteristic texture and flavor.

### Can I use a rolling pin to roll out the Pizza Dough?

Yes, you can use a rolling pin to roll out the Pizza Dough, but be gentle. Pressing too hard can cause the dough to tear or become tough. It's better to use your hands to stretch and shape the dough.

### Do I need a pizza stone to make pizza?

No, you don't need a pizza stone to make pizza. You can bake pizza on a baking sheet or even a cast iron skillet. However, a pizza stone will give you a crispier crust and more even baking.

### How hot should the oven be for making pizza?

The oven should be preheated to 450-500°F (230-260°C) for making pizza. This high heat will help to cook the pizza quickly and evenly.

### How long should I bake the pizza?

This depends on the thickness of your crust and the toppings you are using. As a general rule, you should bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
