- If you don't have fresh rosemary, you can use dried rosemary instead. Just use half the amount called for in the recipe.
- Instead of grilling, you can also cook the lamb chops on a stovetop grill pan or in a broiler.
- Serve the lamb chops with a side of roasted vegetables, potatoes, or a fresh salad for a complete and balanced meal.
