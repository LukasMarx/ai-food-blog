2. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the pot and add the onions. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, carrots, and celery and cook for another 5 minutes.

## Vegetarian Version

To make a vegetarian version of this stew, simply substitute the beef with an equal amount of diced mushrooms. Follow the same instructions for cooking, but reduce the cooking time to 1-2 hours, since mushrooms don't require as long to cook as beef.

## Vegan Version

For a vegan version of this stew, substitute the beef with an equal amount of tofu or seitan. Use vegetable broth instead of beef broth, and make sure to use a vegan-friendly beer (Guinness is not vegan due to the use of isinglass, a fish-derived ingredient, in the brewing process). Follow the same instructions for cooking.

## Gluten-Free Version

To make this stew gluten-free, substitute the Guinness beer with a gluten-free beer or beef broth. Make sure to check that all other ingredients, such as the tomato paste and beef broth, are also gluten-free.

Enjoy this delicious Beef and Guinness Stew with your loved ones on a cozy night in!
