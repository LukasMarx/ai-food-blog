## Tips for Perfect Kebabs

- Soak wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before grilling to prevent them from catching fire.
- Cut meat and vegetables into similar sizes to ensure even cooking.
- Don't overcrowd the skewers. Leave a little bit of space between each piece to allow for air circulation and even cooking.
- Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the beef. It should read at least 145°F for medium-rare, 160°F for medium, or 170°F for well-done.
