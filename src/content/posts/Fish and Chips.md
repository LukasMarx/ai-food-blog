## Vegetarian/Vegan Version

To make a vegetarian version of fish and chips, you can use tofu or tempeh instead of fish. Cut the tofu or tempeh into fillets and coat them in the same batter as the fish. Fry them in the same way and serve them with the chips, tartar sauce, and lemon.

For a vegan version, you can use a vegan beer and replace the eggs in the batter with a plant-based alternative like aquafaba.

## Other Variations

- Use sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes for a healthier twist.
- Add some spices to the batter, like paprika, cayenne pepper, or garlic powder, for extra flavour.

## FAQ

### What type of fish should I use for Fish and Chips?

Traditionally, cod or haddock are used for Fish and Chips, but you can use any firm, white fish like pollock, tilapia, or halibut.

### Can I use a different type of potato?

While russet potatoes are typically used for Fish and Chips, you can use any type of potato that is good for frying, such as Yukon Gold or sweet potatoes.

### Can I make the batter ahead of time?

It's not recommended to make the batter ahead of time, as it will become too thick and won't coat the fish properly. It's best to make the batter right before using it.

### Can I use a different type of oil?

Yes, you can use any type of oil that has a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil.

### Do I need to peel the potatoes?

Yes, it's recommended to peel the potatoes before slicing them into chips for a more traditional dish. However, you can leave the skin on if you prefer.

### Can I bake the fish instead of frying it?

Yes, you can bake the fish instead of frying it for a healthier option. Simply coat the fish in batter and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake at 425°F for 15-20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.

### How do I know when the oil is hot enough?

You can test the oil temperature by dropping a small piece of batter into the oil. If it sizzles and floats to the top, the oil is hot enough.

### Can I reuse the oil?

You can reuse the oil up to 3 times, but it's important to strain it through a fine-mesh strainer and store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.

### Can I make the chips ahead of time?

It's not recommended to make the chips ahead of time, as they will lose their crispiness. It's best to make them right before serving.

### How do I keep the fish and chips crispy?

To keep the fish and chips crispy, place them on a wire rack after frying to allow any excess oil to drain off. Serve immediately for the best texture.
