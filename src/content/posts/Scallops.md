## FAQ

### How do I know when scallops are cooked?

Scallops should be cooked until they are opaque and firm to the touch. Overcooked scallops will become tough and rubbery, so be sure to monitor them closely while cooking.

### Can I use frozen scallops for this recipe?

Yes, you can use frozen scallops for this recipe. Just be sure to thaw them completely before cooking.

### Should I remove the muscle from the scallops before cooking?

Yes, you should remove the muscle from the scallops before cooking. The muscle is a tough, chewy piece of tissue that can be easily removed by gently pulling it away from the scallop.

### How should I season the scallops?

Scallops have a delicate flavor, so a simple seasoning of salt and pepper is often all that is needed. You can also add a touch of lemon juice or garlic for additional flavor.

### What is the best way to cook scallops?

The best way to cook scallops is by searing them in a hot pan with butter or oil. Heat the pan over high heat, then add the scallops and cook for 1-2 minutes per side, until they are golden brown and cooked through.

### Can I marinate the scallops before cooking?

Yes, you can marinate the scallops before cooking. Just be sure not to marinate them for too long, as the acid in the marinade can break down the delicate texture of the scallops.

### Should I rinse the scallops before cooking?

No, you should not rinse the scallops before cooking. Rinsing them can wash away their natural flavor and texture.

### Can I use a nonstick pan to cook scallops?

Yes, you can use a nonstick pan to cook scallops. However, be sure not to overcrowd the pan, as the scallops will release moisture and steam instead of searing.

### How should I serve the scallops?

Scallops are often served as an appetizer or main course. You can serve them with a simple salad or vegetable side dish, or over a bed of pasta or risotto.

### How should I store leftover scallops?

Leftover scallops should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat them gently in a pan with a bit of butter or oil to prevent them from becoming tough and rubbery.
