## Bellini: A Classic Italian Cocktail

The Bellini is a classic Italian cocktail that has been enjoyed for over 80 years. It is a refreshing and fruity drink that is perfect for any occasion, whether you're hosting a brunch or enjoying a relaxing evening at home. The cocktail was invented in the 1940s by Giuseppe Cipriani, the founder of Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy. He named the drink after the painter Giovanni Bellini, who was known for his use of soft, peachy colors in his artwork.

The Bellini is traditionally made with fresh white peaches and Prosecco, a sparkling wine from the Veneto region of Italy. However, frozen peaches or peach purée can also be used to make the drink. The sweetness of the peaches is balanced by the dryness of the Prosecco, making for a perfectly balanced cocktail.
