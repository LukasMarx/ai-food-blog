- 2 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp salt

2. Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs by using a paper towel to grip it and pull it off.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
4. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the ribs, making sure to coat them evenly.

## Variations

- Vegetarian/Vegan: You can use the same seasoning mixture on tofu or tempeh instead of ribs for a vegetarian/vegan option. Grill or bake until crispy and serve with BBQ sauce.
- Smoked Ribs: If you have a smoker, you can smoke the ribs instead of baking them. Follow the same seasoning and sauce instructions, but smoke the ribs at 110°C for 4-5 hours.
- Spicy Ribs: If you like your ribs spicy, add some cayenne pepper or chili powder to the seasoning mixture. You can also use a spicy BBQ sauce or add hot sauce to the regular sauce.
- Baby Back Ribs: This recipe works well with baby back ribs too. Just adjust the cooking time to 2-2.5 hours, depending on the size of the ribs.

Now that you know how to make classic BBQ ribs, it's time to fire up the grill and enjoy a delicious summer meal with your friends and family. Happy cooking!

## FAQ

### How do I prepare the ribs before cooking?

Before cooking, remove the membrane from the back of the ribs, and trim any excess fat. Then, rub the ribs with a dry rub of your choice, and let them sit in the fridge for a few hours or overnight to marinate.

### What is the best way to cook the ribs?

The best way to cook ribs is low and slow. Preheat your grill or smoker to around 225°F, and cook the ribs for 3-4 hours, until the meat is tender and has reached an internal temperature of around 203°F.

### How often should I baste the ribs with BBQ sauce?

Baste the ribs with BBQ sauce every 30 minutes during the last hour of cooking. This will help to create a sticky, caramelized crust on the outside of the ribs.

### Can I cook the ribs in the oven instead of on the grill or smoker?

Yes, you can cook the ribs in the oven if you don't have a grill or smoker. Preheat your oven to 225°F, and cook the ribs for 3-4 hours, until the meat is tender and has reached an internal temperature of around 203°F.

### How do I know when the ribs are done?

The ribs are done when the meat is tender and has pulled back from the bone. You should also be able to insert a toothpick or meat thermometer into the meat without any resistance.

### How long can I store leftover BBQ ribs?

Store leftover BBQ ribs in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days. You can also freeze the ribs for up to 2-3 months.

### Can I use a BBQ sauce that's different from the one listed in the recipe?

Yes, you can use any BBQ sauce you like. However, keep in mind that different sauces may have different levels of sweetness or spiciness, so adjust the amount of sauce you use accordingly.

### How do I reheat leftover BBQ ribs?

Reheat leftover BBQ ribs in the oven or on the grill. Preheat your oven or grill to 350°F, and cook the ribs for 10-15 minutes, until heated through.

### What should I serve with BBQ ribs?

BBQ ribs go well with a variety of sides, including coleslaw, baked beans, corn on the cob, and potato salad.

### What type of wood chips should I use for smoking the ribs?

Hickory, apple, or cherry wood chips are all good choices for smoking ribs. Each type of wood will impart a slightly different flavor to the meat.
