## FAQ

Insert a toothpick or a cake tester in the center of the brownies. If it comes out with a few moist crumbs, the brownies are done. Avoid overbaking the brownies to keep them moist and fudgy.

Yes, you can use unsalted butter instead of salted butter. Just add a pinch of salt to the batter to balance the flavors.

### Can I make the caramel sauce ahead of time?
Yes, you can make the caramel sauce ahead of time and store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Reheat the sauce gently in the microwave or on the stove before using.
