## Variations

Crêpes are incredibly versatile, and there are many ways you can customize them to suit your tastes. Here are a few ideas:

- Savory crêpes: Omit the sugar and vanilla extract from the batter and add some chopped herbs, cheese, or cooked vegetables instead. Serve with ham, eggs, or cream cheese for a delicious savory breakfast.
- Vegan crêpes: Use almond milk or soy milk instead of regular milk and replace the eggs with 1 mashed banana or 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce. The batter will be slightly thicker, so you may need to add a little extra liquid to thin it out.
- Gluten-free crêpes: Use a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour. Rice flour or buckwheat flour work well in this recipe.
- Chocolate crêpes: Add 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to the batter for a rich chocolate flavor. Serve with whipped cream and fresh berries for a decadent dessert.
