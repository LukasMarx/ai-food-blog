## FAQ

### How long should I marinate the chicken for?

We recommend marinating the chicken for at least 2 hours, but ideally overnight. This will ensure that the flavors penetrate the meat and make it more tender.

### Can I use boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts?

Yes, you can use boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. However, the cooking time may be slightly longer as thighs are thicker than breasts.

### Can I cook the chicken on a grill pan instead of a BBQ?

Yes, you can cook the chicken on a grill pan instead of a BBQ. Make sure to preheat the pan over medium-high heat and lightly oil it before adding the chicken.

### How can I tell if the chicken is cooked through?

The best way to tell if the chicken is cooked through is to use a meat thermometer. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken and make sure it reads 165째F (75째C). Alternatively, you can cut into the thickest part of the chicken and make sure there is no pink or raw meat inside.

### How long should I rest the chicken before serving?

We recommend resting the chicken for at least 5 minutes before serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute and make the meat more tender.

### Can I use store-bought BBQ sauce instead of making my own?

Yes, you can use store-bought BBQ sauce instead of making your own. However, homemade BBQ sauce will have a fresher flavor and you can adjust the ingredients to your liking.

### Can I use bone-in chicken instead of boneless chicken?

Yes, you can use bone-in chicken instead of boneless chicken. However, the cooking time will be longer as bone-in chicken takes longer to cook.

### Can I freeze the leftover BBQ chicken?

### Can I use this recipe for BBQ ribs instead of chicken?

Yes, you can use this recipe for BBQ ribs instead of chicken. However, the cooking time will be longer as ribs are thicker and take longer to cook.

### Can I use a different type of wood chips for smoking?
